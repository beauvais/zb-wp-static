					<description><![CDATA[Yes..totally and utterly agree. I can&#039;t believe how bad the new design is. Someone has found the xhtml for sliding menus and is really enjoying using it. A little bit of self indulgence perhaps? For me personally, there is just too much wrong with the new design to go into detail. As with any website, of this kind, functionality should be the priority.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree entirely&lt;br&gt;There was absolutely nothing wrong with the old site - why change something great?&lt;br&gt;I used to like the option of clicking on a channel and seeing all currently available programmes - not available anymore, now you can only apparently see listed programmes shown today and yesterday etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utterly awful - and if you email to complain you are only allowed to use 350 characters, which obviously isnt enough!!!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I cannot download tv where I live but loved the listen again feature for BBC radio.   I hate the new combination of radio and tv - much more complicated and harder to find programmes, no &quot;go back 15 minutes/1 minute&quot;, does not show rate of download and when I pause it and restart it it turns into a stuttering unlisteneable garble.   I have, after much searching, for the moment, found the old radio iplayer on the BBC website.  I have e-mailed the BBC asking them to leave this old format available on their website - but they are not known for taking any notice of the licence fee payers.    I live in a very remote place and have been using radio iplayer for years with no  problems and couldn&#039;t fault it.  I think this is definately a backward step perhaps the BBC have a lot of web page designers they have to keep employed - but changing things that worked well into things that don&#039;t seems stupid.
