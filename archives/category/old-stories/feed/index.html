								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Europe is an interesting topic. Politicians in the UK battle with one another to appear more or less &#8220;Euro-skeptic&#8221; than one another. This week, Tony Blair&#8217;s final as PM, sees him heading over to a summit to discuss the possibility of a new/ammended treaty/constitution. The facts are a bit blurry.</p>
<p>You see, British people are by nature Euroskeptic, except the ones who consider themselves to be more enlightened, who are recovering Euroskeptics. Either position seems to be one of honour to the particular holder.</p>
<p>Facts don&#8217;t come much into the debates. Statistics do, in the same way a pub discussion always includes numbers to back itself up: &#8220;I heard 58% of Americans don&#8217;t know where Europe is!&#8221; Opinion matters, a lot.</p>
<p>Tony Blair has had a difficult time with Europe. It&#8217;s his last week before handing over to the Brown Government (insert pun here) and he has to tread very carefully. He plans to negotiate a new treaty from the charred remains of the European Constitution. First, facts cannot be mentioned too much, because the Euroskeptics will be more convinced than ever that it&#8217;s the end of Britain as we know it. The Europe-enlightened, however, need to know that we are engaging in dialogue with Europe &#8211; dialogue is a favorite word amongst enlightened-type people (I did a dissertation in it!). If nothing happens, it&#8217;s a reminder that Britain is backward and introspective and that we will be left behind when Europe takes off.</p>
<p>So far, vey few articles either in newspapers or on Radio 4&#8217;s hourly updates are particularly elucidating. Last night, the continuity announcer stated that Tony Blair was not prepared to give in unless there were changes &#8220;to key areas&#8221; of the treaty. What we do know is that Blair is being hard/soft on Europe and that he is happy/cautious about his new playmates in Germany and France, but we have no clear picture about what this treaty could mean either way. Blair is &#8216;prepared to walk away&#8217; from treaty talks if he cannot guarantee that the treaty will not be binding in British courts. However, he also doesn&#8217;t want to leave Gordon with anything to be unhappy with (Mr Brown, meet Frau Merkel).</p>
<p>So, walk away or stick around? Anyone have a clue?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along my bus route to work is a bakery which serves a cheap breakfast.<br />
Because I need to change busses just outside its window, I usually have<br />
something to eat during the forty-minute lay over. The woman who runs<br />
the shop makes an interesting character study, and she has been<br />
short-changing me for two months.</p>
<p>It may be that she believes me to be wealthy enough to deserve to<br />
pay more for her food. While this is ridiculous (I&#8217;ve been a student<br />
for three years, and my wife is still finishing her 5-year degree!), I<br />
guess having to wear a suit gives this impression.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, she always adds a few pence to the total. Over<br />
the past few weeks, she has also taken to giving me less change than<br />
even the additional total would require. So, I might have bought a<br />
sandwich and coffee which should cost £1.50, and she&#8217;ll say: &#8220;That&#8217;s<br />
£1.75, love&#8221;. If I give her a five-pound note, I may only receive £1.80<br />
in change. I&#8217;ve overlooked this on a number of occasions, not because<br />
the food is great (it is plain, and the bread often from the previous<br />
night), nor because the place is particularly pleasant (It isn&#8217;t). No.<br />
I have overlooked it because I couldn&#8217;t believe she would consistently<br />
steal from me.</p>
<p>This morning, however,  she took it a step further. After giving me<br />
a larger-than-necessary total and subsequently short-changing me (by<br />
£1!), she called me back into the shop to say she hadn&#8217;t charged me for<br />
my scone&#8230;</p>
<p>Every morning, I hear her say to a customer &#8220;There&#8217;s no sausages, I<br />
haven&#8217;t had time to get them on this morning.&#8221; Her display cabinets,<br />
however, are always empty; and she has to put the coffee on for me<br />
(then makes instant anyway). This conflicts strongly with my impression<br />
of early-morning, working eating. During several months of manual<br />
labour, we started the day at 7 with a full breakfast from a cafe which<br />
had been open (and busy) for an hour or more. This shop opens at 7, and<br />
by 8:40, nothing is filled, and &#8220;there&#8217;s no sausages&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you have,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how much did I charge you?</p>
<p>&#8220;£2.70&#8221; (with £1.30 change which I didn&#8217;t mention)</p>
<p>&#8220;£2.70&#8230;&#8221; after a considerable pause, during which I did not let her look away</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I have, yes, I remember, I have&#8221;</p>
<p>I  shan&#8217;t be eating there again, I think. Sometimes a quid is too far to budge!</p>
