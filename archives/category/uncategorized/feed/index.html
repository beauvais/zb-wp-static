								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever had a superficial conversation suddenly run your blood cold?</p>
<p>On the short cab-ride to my hotel following FOWA (more to follow), the cab driver was explaining the extension of the conference venue. This is not usually the preamble to a conversation that changes your perspectives, except maybe on the architectural uses of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/2308811412">steel spider&#8217;s legs and concrete</a>. However, he was saying that the folks that bought Manchester United (<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/L1425234.php">actually, he should have said City</a>), bought the Excel centre for a $1billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently,&#8221; said the cabby, &#8220;they do a lot of, you know, &#8216;God conferences&#8217;, evangelical like, yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221; I enquired—shocked because I&#8217;d been greeted by some charismatics in red teeshirts on my first visit to FOWA, and they&#8217;d been there every morning, greeting folks entering the conference and—strangely—leaving the toilets.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/1380640085_4192fb838b.jpg?resize=206%2C154"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 5px;" title="religion" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/1380640085_4192fb838b.jpg?resize=206%2C154" alt="" width="206" height="154" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>&#8220;Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of money in it over in the States. Folks that run &#8217;em want to come to England, and get some British God-money, I guess. Problem for them is: there aren&#8217;t any places big enough! So, they buy it, and are building a bigger place. Lots of dosh!&#8221;</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I had cynically been thinking to myself that the red-tee-shirted cohort of pentecostals greeting me by name (no, nothing spiritual—we all wear name-tags!) had been selected for their good looks and ethnic diversity. But I thought I was being cynical.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: I overheard maybe ten conversations between geeks (It was a web conference, after all) about the &#8220;religious people/ god-folk/ Christian nutters&#8221;, and my heart sank. One or two said that a cheery greeting first thing in the morning is quite nice. Most, however, thought they were over-bearing, weird, or strangely sexy.</p>
<p>The thing that gets me here, is that the public image of Jesus&#8217; followers is horribly maimed here. Wasn&#8217;t it Jesus who through money-changers out of the temple? Wasn&#8217;t it Jesus who went to societies low-lifes and changed their worlds? You think he would have scored well with a PR agency? Think he had a Marketing team or cheer-leaders?</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing spiritual they [Arab investors in the venue] get is this:&#8221; and the cabby rubbed his fingers in the international symbol of money.</p>
<p>What should I say to this? I&#8217;m lost for words&#8230;</p>

<p>I have a quite deep, wooden desk with drawers which tend to fill with clutter. I&#8217;ve decided to feed a powerstrip through the back of one of the drawers so I can plug in two usb hubs and my MacBook power cable there, out of the way. I&#8217;ve also managed to organise a system for filing my papers (I hate paper, it should always be on screen and searchable!) loosely based on the GTD (Getting Things Done) meme.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ve done is to mount a powerstrip to the back of the desk, so I lose some of the trailing cables. It still amazes me, though, how many wires a single of<a href="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2613549142_7f63c351d7.jpg?w=240" class="lightview" rel="gallery[desk]"><img alt="Office Space" title="Officespace" style="max-width: 800px; float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2613549142_7f63c351d7.jpg?w=240" height="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>fice space can generate! There&#8217;s still a cluttered feeling to the desk, and there&#8217;s nothing on it aside from computing paraphanelia.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning to put some shelves behind the monitor—the desk is very deep—on which to place external hard-drive and other necessities. I&#8217;d like to hide the cables behind it somehow, so they aren&#8217;t trailing in any way. I&#8217;ve bundled all the cabling with wire ties, and fed most leads through the monitor back, creating a funnel. The overall appearance, though, is still a bit too ad-hoc or rustic or&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>What do you think? What would you do with this desk space?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/www.kiva.org"></a>It&#8217;s been a few months since I last spoke about Kiva.org, and I wanted to bring it up again. </p>
<p>Since writing, I&#8217;ve tried out the lending scheme, and am blown away with the ability to make a difference to places where it&#8217;s seriously needed. Not only has Kiva created an infrastructure for microlending which makes it incredibly easy to lend small amounts to entrepreneurs in developing countries, but it makes use of the very nature of the Web in connecting you with people all over the world. </p>
<p>The idea of &#8216;sponsorship&#8217; isn&#8217;t really stressed. This isn&#8217;t a: &#8220;For pennies a day, you could clean this water&#8230;&#8221; It&#8217;s much more of a chance to invest directly into the lives of people who need it, and have a chance to pull themselves up. </p>
<p>My primary worry, when lending (giving) is that I&#8217;ll be made to feel like a vouyer in some way. Instead of concern, I worry that I will be made to focus on fascination or curiosity. This doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case with Kiva. Although it doesn&#8217;t feel like a standard business transaction, it does present enough facts in a straight-forward way. There is not over-blown language, but clear presentation of cases.</p>
<p>I also feel more comfortable lending directly to &#8220;partners&#8221; in developing nations. I feel this is much more efficient, and more in the spirit of a digital age. Why would I want to pay the salary of a well-meaning (and not, in any way exploitative) but still Western individual with my giving, when I can invest directly in people already poised to make a difference?</p>
<p>Finally, and possibly most importantly: Kiva doesn&#8217;t take any cut of the loans they provide. Instead, they ask for a separate donation (without any nag or detriment to the service). They don&#8217;t make a big deal of this (rightly), but I feel I should mention it. These people are providing a world-changing service, with few resources, without charging anything for &#8216;upkeep&#8217;. Not only that, but they only ask after you&#8217;ve chosen an amount and a project to support, making it less likely for you to lower your loan amount at that stage to compensate the infrastructure.</p>
<p>To my mind, this is the future of peer-to-peer investment and development. Now, we just need a way to send other resources in a similar infrastructure (education, information, digital resources, experience, and design).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
I was listening to one of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/stephenfry.com" title="Stephen Fry's Site">Stephen Fry</a>&#8216;s &#8216;podgrams&#8217;—&#8221;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/?p=42" title="Stephen Fry's Wallpaper">Wallpaper</a>&#8220;—in which he briefly touched on the idea that the English tend to classify something as &#8216;pretentious&#8217; if they don&#8217;t understand it. It&#8217;s a form of defense of tradition or perspective. Intelligence or flamboyance are marked as a personality flaw; people exhibiting uncomfortable behaviour or traits are disarmed by being seen as blemished. Pretension is perhaps the greatest fuel for satire and ironic mockery—maybe because it produces such good, well-recognised material. It is <span style="font-style: italic;">funny</span> to see pretentious people mocked, and they are therefore rendered harmless. (I find particular hilarity in piss-taking of Tony Blair and would happily laugh at someone poking fun at <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/jacqui-smiths-new-immigration-measures-are-a-pointless-gesture/" title="some bile directed at the current home secretary">Jacqui Smith</a>, also!)</p>
<p>I think I recognise this, and I wonder whether there might not be more perspective defenses? The way we perceive the world—metaphorically &#8220;see&#8221;—is a deeply personal and fundamental aspect of our characters. Perhaps it&#8217;s tied in with our own beliefs about ourselves to such an extent that a conflict of perspective resonates with an attack on our person.</p>
<p>We defend our perspectives, especially perspectives involving personality or other foundational ideas, because they are metaphorical constructs to help us understand our world. Maybe that&#8217;s why it hurts so much to be called pretentious (speaking from the platform of a much-called pretentious git)? Because one is consigned to the same category as the most-maligned in cultural conscience?</p>
<p>Makes me think&#8230;</p>

<p>I got home last night to find a note from the Post Office confirming that the anticipated Amazon parcel had arrived. Also waiting for me were three editions of the <em><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/www.ft.com">Financial Times</a></em>, this month&#8217;s <em>Wired</em> and this month&#8217;s <em>Harvard Business Review</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still reading last month&#8217;s HBR! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And I need to reread <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/0062515861%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Weaving the Web</a> before next week. Hmm&#8230; clearly time to stop sleeping or something.</p>

<p>Because I work with the internet, I tend to see things from an &#8216;online&#8217; perspective. When I see a presentation, I ask why it doesn&#8217;t link to resources and I tend to Google answers and keep many tabs open with on-the-fly further reading on a subject. One of the most wide-spread of all internet buzzwords is &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221;. The ideas behind it have been summed up (indeed, coined) by the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oreillynet.com%2Fpub%2Fa%2Foreilly%2Ftim%2Fnews%2F2005%2F09%2F30%2Fwhat-is-web-20.html&amp;ei=qWzVRvCkCJCkwgHhodzFDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrMnlCMikX1cayz1Xzjf4TVVTr9Q&amp;sig2=Uyh4bM1oyRKsMEnLupopKg">O&#8217;Reilly network</a>. To me, many of these have a strong resonance with the &#8216;newly painted church&#8217; of Mars Hill. For example, there is an emphasis in Web 2.0 on participation and &#8220;The long tail&#8221; which I see reflected in &#8220;every member ministry&#8221; and discussions instead of sermons. Teaching has taken on a very interactive flavour, and theology is less about rules.</p>
<p>While the tag &#8216;Church 2.0&#8217; is wildly inaccurate on one score (e.g. there have been many renditions of the church), the notion of a renaissance is definitely present and many of the tenets of Web 2.0 can be helpfully used as metaphor in the church.</p>
<p><b>Participation vs. Preaching:</b></p>
<p>With links to various incarnations of the &#8216;Cell&#8217; movement, the idea of discussion supplementing or even replacing pulpit-sermons is certainly not new. The practice of church services on Sunday mornings, however, tends to keep its principle of being taught from the front. I think this is changing, however, and I think we will see a decline in traditional sermons with points backed by scripture. My old church in the States believed in an &#8216;expository&#8217; teaching style. The idea being that the Bible would be taught through, verse-by-verse instead of shaping its truth to a pre-fabricated set of points. I believe the next step is working out the meaning of the Bible together with a collaborative teaching in which people ask and answer their own questions. While I have yet to completely read Mars Hill&#8217;s &#8216;Narrative Theology&#8217; I can see reflections there.</p>
<p>A wise friend of mine recently told me: &#8220;<i>The truth&#8217;s in the dialogue</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where does the pitfall lie in this new direction?</p>
<p><strong>The Body and the Long Tail:</strong></p>
<p>There will be more&#8230;</p>
