								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How I miss Ludlow.</p>
<p>A brace of pheasants in the feather for less than a fiver – hanging from one of Ludlow&#8217;s five local butchers. Each dwelling in a building made by medieval tradesmen.</p>
<p>Cobblestones, of course, usually damp, with overhanging late-medieval timbers just overhead. If you duck and twist to the market square, you can buy the most expensive fruitcake known to man – quenched like a blacksmith&#8217;s goods in fine whisky.</p>
<p>Gardens bloom gloriously due to obsessive tinkerers in horticulture. They&#8217;re mad as a skip of toads, of course, but  I&#8217;ll be damned if they can&#8217;t design and dig the most stunning tiny plots of land as if practicing to become groundspeople for vast stately homes.</p>
<p>There, at the top, is a square, guarded by a large field gun taken at Sebastopol – something Tennyson would likely swoon to straddle and make boom noises: &#8220;Half a league onward – boom!&#8221; Behind the cannon&#8217;s muzzle sprawls the Norman Ludlow Castle. Pay a pretty few pence (easier to use notes, actually – it&#8217;s not a cheap day out, if I recall correctly), and you can stand in the keep of the Lords of the March. From here, Wales was governed, and Mortimer plotted to take over all of England, making the king wear the cuckold&#8217;s horns before making a divisive decision that left the four quarters of his body rather unhandily inaccessible to his plans.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to see the wool church from the centre, but take a few paces out of town and the cathedral-like St Lawrence&#8217;s tells you this place once rolled in cash.</p>
<p>I once carried a Christmas tree on my shoulder from the winter&#8217;s market – down the hill on old Corve Street, right the way to the still damp from the floods end of town where we lived. Several passing people asked if I&#8217;d forgotten its decorations. One offered to help. I was in high spirits indeed, for this was my home now.</p>
<p>I drank pints of Shropshire-brewed ale while reading books in quiet pubs on chairs where people had been drinking pints of Shropshire-brewed ale since before  – well before anything my childhood world contained.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“So, this just swings over your jacket, and just hook this bit under your… where’s your tie?” The spindly man from Ede and Ravenscroft held some form of heavy, black wool cloth and cordage out to me.</p>
<p>“I’m not wearing one. I don’t own one. Wait, do I need a tie to graduate? I thought I’d be wearing a robe or something?”</p>
<p>“Well, the hood goes over your robe and hooks under your tie.” He reiterated, staring at my throat. He wasn’t offering me alternatives. He didn’t see a way out of this situation without my wearing a tie. Also, I was starting to worry that he was looking for more than a tie under my chin – maybe an artery? He did strike me as the vampire-type. He seemed ready to spring, and had pale, bony hands sticking out of his double-cuffed shirt and three-piece suit. Cold hands in a stifling basement room? And, <em>Ede and Ravenscroft?</em> Definite vampire.</p>
<p>“OK, look I think I saw ties in the college shit they’re selling at the entrance. I’ll be right back.” I didn’t want to draw attention my lack of jacket – the tie problem was enough.</p>
<p>Shit. I thought I had this sorted. If there’s one thing I’d learned over the past three years, it’s that any event in London would be uncomfortably hot, cold, wet, or crowded. Given the season – and past two weeks of watching parks turn into sandlots – I banked on it being hot <em>and</em> crowded. So, two weeks before the date, I made a special trip to Marks and Spencer on the train, and picked up what I considered to be a smart shirt. I didn’t know that a button-down collar on a short-sleeved shirt isn’t something one wears to a graduation. Especially – it seemed – one’s own.</p>
<p>Everyone I ran past was wearing a suit or posh dress. I was starting to reconsider my lifestyle. A five-foot eleven, 18-stone, bearded transvestite would certainly draw attention, but at least they’d be less warm in a thin cotton dress. Maybe off-the shoulder? Definitely better than doing up the top button, and essentially wrapping a thin scarf around their neck.</p>
<p>“Hey, do you know if they sell ties from that stand with all the college shit?” I asked my mate, having run the half-mile from the basement to the entrance. “And, what the fuck is a barbican, anyway?”</p>
<p>“I’ve no idea, but I think there’s only one. This one: <em>The Barbican</em>.” I could hear the capital letters.</p>
<p>“And yes, I think they have ties. Why, did you forget yours? Are you sure you didn’t leave it with your blazer.”</p>
<p>“My what?”</p>
<p>“Never mind.” He eyed my bare forearms. “Yes, ties – College ties, I think. Over that way – run. Are all Yanks like you?”</p>
<p>“Oh hell no. But, remind me to tell you about trailer parks in the desert and why we don’t wear fucking ties and wool coats in the summer. Also, isn’t your country supposed to be grey and rainy? It’s like 90 degrees in here!”</p>
<p>“No, it’s 30. And, run.” He pointed toward the foyer.</p>
<p>The exchange with the man – also besuited – selling college shit was essentially more of the same back-and-forth about ties, jackets, and telling glances at my now-sweat-beaded, bare forearms.</p>
<p>“We have several ties. You can have the colours, or the arms, or…”</p>
<p>I grabbed a nice blue one with shields on, and balked at the price tag.</p>
<p>“Er, I don’t suppose there’s a student discount… no? OK, I’ll take it.”</p>
<p>Tying and jogging is a skill I discovered on my way back to the basement. I presented myself again to the gentleman’s tailor to the Duke of Edinburgh, or Prince of Wales, or whatever. “I have a tie.”</p>
<p>“Quite.”</p>
<p>He waited while I donned a robe, and hooked the cord around my throat. He struggled not to use it as a garrotte.</p>
<p>“Right, don’t forget your hat. And remember, you’re not to wear it indoors.”</p>
<p>“OK. Wait, are we going outside?” I asked, hoping I could at least catch a breeze.</p>
<p>“No. This is an indoor graduation ceremony.”</p>
<p>“OK, I’ll just leave the hat then.”</p>
<p>“Your hat is required. Just don’t wear it.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Memory is a long-exposure photo. Things that move the least hold the best focus.</p>
<p>Picture a room from your childhood home. Parts of it are so clear, you almost feel you could turn a corner and <em>be</em> there. Your fingers feel the texture of those curtains, and you notice the definite smell of sun-heated windowsills – something you didn’t realise you could remember, and had never thought to recall.</p>
<p>But, then look closer at the picture. What colour is that sofa? Wait, it’s blue – no: beige. That bit of artwork? It’s over there, and it’s a cheesy print in a brass frame. No, that’s in the other room, and what I see is a family-portrait (also cheesy, mind) collage.</p>
<p>But that table, you can picture every scratch, even though the books in the shelf behind it are grey blur. The telly is in the same place, but changes sizes as you squint – getting a bit thinner, with more – than fewer – black boxes beneath it, blinking green and orange leds at different rates.</p>
<p>Your pets seem to be all ages at once. That old dog’s greying snout shares the space of a younger, athletic one, and the puppy with floppy ears before it. But his eyes are clear, and you could reach out now and stroke just behind his ear.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thing is, despite the many people, none gave me a second look. And, I&#8217;d never looked more guilty of breaking and entering in my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Zak!&#8221; I could hear the k in the way he said my name.<br />
&#8220;I forgot to put a microwave in your flat. You want one, yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, that&#8217;d be perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;OK. Walk with me. We go to my place where I keep such things, and you take whatever you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, we walked down the road, an ill-matched pair if ever there were one.</p>
<p>My Cypriot landlord was a small man, but he craned his neck up at no one. He occupied a greater space on the pavement than I did – and I overtopped him by a head, and let&#8217;s just say I couldn&#8217;t hide from anything by standing behind him width-wise, either.</p>
<p>He stopped and picked up a rather beautiful, fruiting chilli plant from its stand in front of the Turkish grocers&#8217; shop.</p>
<p>&#8220;You like these spicy things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, yeah. Where I grew up, Mexican food is probably the most common thing we eat. The spicier, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We use these much in my food from Cyprus, too. I love hot. Hot food, hot weather, hot everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, I was enjoying his enthusiasm. He continued to gush over his botanical wisdom. His words always flowed effortlessly – and with little pause. So, I had to rethink his last bit for a few paces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, I missed that. Chilies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, chilies, tomatoes, potatoes, and chocolate – so many things we eat – the things we <em>love</em> to eat! They are a gift. From space. Outer space.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waved upwards.</p>
<p>Yes, I had heard him right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Er, space? I think they&#8217;re from Mexico, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well yes, Mexico and Guatemala and those places. But that&#8217;s where they are from <em>here</em>. The best things we eat were brought down from out there. You know they have those big temples, yes? Pyramids in the jungle! Who would build such big things in the middle of there, eh? Those people, long time ago, they build those things to let aliens land. And, they gave them such things as these.&#8221;</p>
<p>He brandished the potted shrub with a gesture very much like a barrister&#8217;s closing statement. &#8220;I have provided indisputable counsel, and my case rests&#8221; the chilli plant waving said.</p>
<p>We had to walk back a bit, so he could return the chilli. He continued to tell me how we&#8217;ve lost so much we could have had from our benevolent, interplanetary friends. Wondrous technologies, limitless medicine. They once never died from cancer in Central America, apparently.</p>
<p>So, onward we walked. One of us a bantam kingpin, the other a baffled, outsized student. We came to a corner flat, and many keys emerged from my landlord&#8217;s pocket. I still wonder how he managed to stuff a grapefruit-sized clutch of keys into perfectly-tailored clothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are. Microwaves are there, near the cookers. I keep many things here. Take, and I&#8217;ll lock up.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, I selected a still shrink-wrapped box from the flat-hoard of white goods. The place held more stock than a decent high-street home ware shop. He struggled with the door for a bit, while I looked on – head turned at a weird angle. He pulled at a robust chain for a while, then dropped it and kicked it back inside. He rattled the door for a bit, finally pulling it to, and waved me off, back to my subterranean flat with my very own, brand-new microwave.</p>
<p>I stopped to buy some chilies from the Turkish grocer, who was only mildly amused that I conducted the transaction from beneath a heavy box. But, I couldn&#8217;t resist. And, you never know: I might make contact with an offering of extra-terrestrial produce.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m squirming at a photo of this spoon I carved from a bit of ash. Nothing about this piece is any good at all. If I were gracious, I&#8217;d call it asymmetrical. But, really, it&#8217;s lopsided. The walls are thick, clunky. Neither the shape nor lines of the handle inspire grace.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Share this now?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think not.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather no one ever sees this. Unfortunately, I believe that particular spoon ended up in someone&#8217;s kitchen. Three years ago, I&#8217;d been carving for a while, and I was excited by this monstrosity. I saw the smooth finish, the places where I&#8217;d managed to carve away dodgy grain without too much tear out. I wanted to share it then – foisting my barely-shaped bits of wood onto patient, kind friends.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t see all the flaws. Hell, I didn&#8217;t even know what I&#8217;d need to make a spoon like this work. To be fair to my past self, a year or two before this so-called spoon, I had only just picked up a carver&#8217;s knife. I didn&#8217;t know how to keep a blade sharp. The bits of wood I scratched about with weren&#8217;t even recognisable as spoons. Before then, I didn&#8217;t know how to carve anything.</p>
<p>Today, I fed two spoons I wasn&#8217;t happy with into my fire. They&#8217;re actually quite symmetrical, and the handle sweeps fairly elegantly from grip to tip of bowl. They wear a proper finial, and they&#8217;re fairly comfortable in the hand. But, I can see where I&#8217;ve gone wrong, and they&#8217;re not good enough to keep. I wouldn&#8217;t give them to anyone, and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t sell them. The bowl&#8217;s bevels don&#8217;t line up, and I can&#8217;t tweak them further without removing enough wood to ruin the shape. So, into the fire they go.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine, though. There are sixteen eating spoons I&#8217;m happy enough with to keep. I can see several I could improve, and I&#8217;m pretty sure what I&#8217;ll do next to change some of the minor faults. I&#8217;m better at this now.</p>

<p>They live in a bowl I recently turned on a pole lathe in my front porch. This bowl is my fifth or maybe sixth. It&#8217;s the first that&#8217;s even and turned out more or less the shape I wanted. The others went into the fire. I&#8217;m excited by this bowl, and I want to share it.</p>

<p>In 2020, Facebook will pop up with a photo of this lovely bowl: <em>&#8220;Share this now?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;ll squirm, saying: &#8220;I think not.&#8221; I&#8217;ll wish that bloody bowl had ended up on the fire, and that Facebook&#8217;s memory algorithm could go hang.</p>
<p>I hope this, because I&#8217;ll know how to hold the tricky hook tools so they don&#8217;t gouge into the surface too badly. My new bowls will look elegant, and I&#8217;ll see minor flaws to sort in the next one. I&#8217;ll know how to fix my mistakes, and the next steps will be clearer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be better at this then.</p>
<p>My craft somehow informs my politics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, remember this idea you championed 20 years ago? It sucked.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, it did. But, we&#8217;re better at this now. We squirm at old systems – outmoded models and beliefs. But, to be fair to ourselves – at least a little – that was the first time we&#8217;d tried that. Before then, we didn&#8217;t know how such a plan would work.</p>
<p>We can see our mistakes, but we can also see how we&#8217;ve adapted. We&#8217;re better at seeing what&#8217;s wrong now, and we can see some next steps. We can do better, and we want to make those changes.</p>
<p>In 20 years, we&#8217;ll read our old material from way back in 2017. We&#8217;ll squirm. We&#8217;ll see our flaws, and wish we&#8217;d done things differently. We&#8217;ll laugh at what we called progress back then.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be better at this then.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s too easy to draw lazy comparisons between the rise of Trump&#8217;s particular brand of fascism with the policies of the Third Reich, and I&#8217;m aware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law">Godwin&#8217;s law</a>. But, I&#8217;ve been saying so many times in the last year that we&#8217;re all in trouble.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a slow rise of fascist dogma, that seems impervious to reason. And I want to understand this. Part of this seems easy to figure out: the world&#8217;s power has shifted from nations to elsewhere: corporations (banks too big to fail, Exon, G4S), pan-national organisations (EU, NATO, UN), extremely wealthy individuals. There&#8217;s a stronger skew in the distribution of goods than ever before*. People feel disaffected, because they&#8217;re more aware that they&#8217;re not connected to their own destinies. I know people who didn&#8217;t even know to whom they paid their mortgage.</p>
<p>This disconnect is dangerous – and I want to study it.</p>
<p>But, where is the change that leads us toward making decisions that sound so achingly like early 20th-century fascism? Blame minority populations, and start purges that break down the very notion of citizenship:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Barack Obama will leave office with Guantánamo Bay still in operation as a detention facility. Trump’s election ensures the infamous wartime prison escapes closure, but it will probably cross a constitutional Rubicon. The president-elect has pledged to increase the Guantánamo population, a reversal of Obama’s approach, “with some bad dudes”. Among those “bad dudes”, Trump told the Miami Herald, could be American citizens. His pledge to bring back “worse than waterboarding” threatens to undo the shaky coalition against torture, especially in a GOP Congress, of the late Bush and Obama administrations.&#8221; – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-president-policy-immigration-agenda-healthcare">Guardian</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the beginning of a rerun of the reticent then cataclysmic second world war. Nor is it a throw back further to the global tension, secretive oligarchic politicking, and class division of the first. This is our new, global tension.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not looking at the rise of belligerent nations after the world rebuilds itself from global war. We&#8217;re part of the story of the world tearing itself apart after a tense peace. We have built a division between cultures of progress and tradition. Left/right, liberal/conservative: semantically empty labels that yet carry huge power.</p>
<p>Clearly, some people are uncomfortable with the ideas of the other people. Some are afraid that their perspectives on the world aren&#8217;t respected by others – over the exact same issues. Some can&#8217;t understand how the other people don&#8217;t understand their point of view. We are not seeing the same world, but do we know this about ourselves? Are we aware that there are many facets to our lives, and that from a single perspective, you cannot even see obverses?</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the beginning of an end to national supremacy.</p>
<p>Or, maybe it&#8217;s just the decline of an empire.</p>
<p>Ave atque vale, Pax Americana.</p>
<p>*Though, the Norman-imposed style of feudalism might have been as or more skewed, it&#8217;s hard to make comparisons.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent article in the Guardian prompted me to ask an open-ended question on Facebook. What followed is the beginning of an interesting conversation, which I&#8217;d like to study further.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I asked:</p>
<p><em>Is it just pensions, or is it because more wealth is in the hands of fewer people overall that we are worse off than our parents&#8217; generation?</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/07/revealed-30-year-economic-betrayal-dragging-down-generation-y-income">Guardian article</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Exclusive new data shows how debt, unemployment and property prices have combined to stop millennials taking their share of western wealth
</p></blockquote>
<p><em>cf.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2016/01/62-people-own-same-as-half-world-says-oxfam-inequality-report-davos-world-economic-forum">Oxfam article</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  62 people own same as half world.
</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Don Nalezyty</strong>:</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a combination of many factors. Concentration of wealth certainly plays a big role, but there are many more factors and the author hit on many in the article.</p>
<p>I think globalization in the last few decades has had significant impact. The math is pretty simple. If you allow free trade with countries where the cost of manufacturing is significantly less and those manufacturing jobs are lost, you can&#8217;t make up those lost blue-collar jobs with new technology or white-collar jobs. The crazy thing is that it&#8217;s self reinforcing &#8211; the cost of goods drops and the government is not concerned about overall income dropping for the average Joe, because everything costs less&#8230; it&#8217;s a fallacy that these economic arrangements have long-term benefit, but again the government doesn&#8217;t really care, because those benefiting from these policies are spending the big money to elect their peers and those willing to protect their interests.</p>
<p>The cost of education has skyrocketed in the US in that same time frame, but again their are fewer jobs to be had. It&#8217;s policy at many US based global companies to hire cheaper labor in emerging markets with preference over US citizens, because they cost too much to employ. There is often a preference for employing folks with H1B status here in the States for the same reason. It&#8217;s not that there are no US candidates in the market, but that they cost too much. So young folks that are spending two to three times more for their college education than I did are competing for fewer and fewer jobs that pay less.</p>
<p>I think that the great recession as it&#8217;s been called has not ended, nor have we seen the worst of it. I think this trend is going to continue until it hits some sort of breaking point. I&#8217;m not sure what form it will take, but it&#8217;s going to have to get much worse before the people start affecting real change in the political arena.</p>
<p><strong>Zach Beauvais</strong>:</p>
<p>Yes, definitely. I think part of the breaking point can already be seen in the choices people make in the political arena – e.g. Trump (or even Cruz, for that matter) – and the rise of security-based rhetoric, which directly addresses fear. People are physically safer than at any time in the history of the world – for the most part – but they are uneasy, which leads to fear. And, security promises safety, which is a reaction to fear. I think the unease is partly down to financial security, but not all of it – and that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m struggling to find good reasons.</p>
<p>Another is in the choices we make about longer-term problems, such as climate change. We&#8217;re scared now, so the future (even the not-so-distant future) is a problem for later. Right now, we&#8217;re scared, and we don&#8217;t understand why we&#8217;re scared.</p>
<p>The problem with fear is that it short-cuts reason. Sure, we can publish studies that show violent crime is down, but we&#8217;re scared, so we retreat to fortresses and arm ourselves. This escalates tension, and we start looking for threats.</p>
<p>Which is partly why people are looking to blame the other – anything that&#8217;s not familiar. Immigrants, technology, even studies or education: all suffer from being distrusted and feared.</p>
<p>I think these are playing a role in authoritarian rhetoric, record sales in arms and defence budgets, and anti-intellectualism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reading about <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/ve/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/politics-general-interest/authoritarian-dynamic">authoritarian rhetoric</a>, and want to dig deeper into the discourse. I&#8217;ve got a niggle that the way we choose the things we read (watch, hear) is also affecting the way we talk about and relate to the world. We don&#8217;t watch the same news, like our parents did – we choose ever more-focused media.</p>

I will be leaving the lovely team at <a href="http://this.isfluent.com">Fluent</a>, where I have been their in-house content strategist for over a year. I have accepted a very tempting offer from a company called <a href="http://zengenti.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zengenti</a>.</p>
<p>Zengenti produces an enterprise-sized content management system (CMS), which powers big websites – such as Kings College London (my alma mater). My new title will be Head of Content and Communities, and the job description is quite wide. I&#8217;ll be working with pretty much every team, and helping clients to organise their content (which is, after all, what websites are for), and make the most of their websites. I&#8217;ll also be helping Zengenti to build up and support their community of users and partner companies.</p>
<p>Zengenti is based in Ludlow, and I&#8217;ll be working there two days each week, and remotely the rest. They have a good team, and I know a few folk already through an event I started years back called <a href="http://www.shropgeek.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shropgeek</a>.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to spending time in my favourite place on earth, and equally having more time here in our new (and first) home.</p>

<p>This was not part of the confirmation service I was expecting. Members of the Ely Cathedral congregation were urged with a splash to recall their original commitment to Christ. It&#8217;s a tricky task for most, being asked to bring to mind a service in which they took part as infants. To make it easier, we were reminded of the promises made by our godparents.</p>
<p>Thing is, I haven&#8217;t got any godparents. And, I can remember my baptism with clarity:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Zachariah, I now baptise you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Buried&#8230;&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest was washed out by the inrush of chilly water, and the sensation of being submerged backwards by a big, kind-hearted man who&#8217;s grin was remarkably like that of the rosemary-brandishing bishop. But I knew the rest of the words by heart:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;&#8230; in likeness of His death. Raised again to walk in the newness of life.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I re-lived my baptism, I was taking part in a service of confirmation, alongside two friends with whom I&#8217;ve shared several months of lessons. My plans to be confirmed as an Anglican have been a conversation-starter:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10292" data-permalink="https://beggingaquestion.com/archives/remember-baptism/a-small-prayer-cross-i-carved-from-laurel-wood/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1554554_10100396671150236_9220810401566434756_n-1_mcul28.jpg?fit=403%2C537&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="403,537" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="A small prayer cross I carved from laurel wood." data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1554554_10100396671150236_9220810401566434756_n-1_mcul28.jpg?fit=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1554554_10100396671150236_9220810401566434756_n-1_mcul28.jpg?fit=403%2C537&amp;ssl=1" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10292" src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1554554_10100396671150236_9220810401566434756_n-1_mcul28-225x300.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="photo of a carved, wooden cross" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1554554_10100396671150236_9220810401566434756_n-1_mcul28.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1554554_10100396671150236_9220810401566434756_n-1_mcul28.jpg?w=403&amp;ssl=1 403w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" data-recalc-dims="1" />&#8220;Wait, weren&#8217;t you confirmed already?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, sort of. I was raised in the Baptist tradition of Christianity, but the teaching of both are remarkably similar. The Church of England teaches that confirmation is an adult decision to commit your life to Christ. The Baptists say the same, but with more water, and tie confirmation and baptism together into one almighty dunking.</p>
<p>I see my recent confirmation as a reaffirmation of my decision to follow Christ. My baptism means no less to me, though I was only eight. Being anointed with oil in a cathedral is a chapter from my story with the church as I am now – at very nearly 30.</p>

Every caller I&#8217;ve heard has complained, and is scared about their data. My own reaction is conflicted.</p>
<p>I used to work as an evangelist for a company that advocated open data. I believe that opening up data tends to enable progress. You know that quick-fire game where you say the first thing that comes to mind? If you said: &#8220;open data,&#8221;</p>
<p>I would say: &#8220;accountable government,&#8221; or &#8220;better research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, I would probably say: &#8220;wait, what?&#8221; – I&#8217;m not as eloquent in real life without a text editor.</p>
<p>Also, a hero of mine, Ben Goldacre, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/nhs-plan-share-medical-data-save-lives?CMP=twt_gu">wrote about care.data</a>, pointing out that this data could absolutely save lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We learn how to save lives by studying huge datasets on the medical histories of millions of people. This information helps us identify the causes of cancer and heart disease; it helps us to spot side-effects from beneficial treatments, and switch patients to the safest drugs; it helps us spot failing hospitals, or rubbish surgeons; and it helps us spot the areas of greatest need in the NHS.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He highlights some of my conflict by saying that there are problems with the way the scheme has been launched, and it hasn&#8217;t taken into consideration the concerns we have about privacy, security and access. Dr. Goldacre concludes that we should watch and wait before opting out.</p>
<p>But I have decided to opt out of care.data, and tweeted about it quite strongly.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you haven&#39;t faxed your GP yet to opt out of care.data, then read this. Then Opt Out! (<a href="https://twitter.com/FaxYourGP">@FaxYourGP</a>) <a href="http://t.co/tbWMtaQlTx">http://t.co/tbWMtaQlTx</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Zach Beauvais (@beauvais) <a href="https://twitter.com/beauvais/status/437914135347871744">February 24, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This is why.</p>
<h2>They haven&#8217;t told me enough about who gets access to my private, medical information.</h2>
<p>All the information you need to make your decision about whether you want to opt out of care.data is in a leaflet (link to pdf). And it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We will use information such as your postcode and NHS number to link your records from these different places. Records are linked in a secure system so your identity is protected.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We sometimes release confidential information to approved researchers, if this is allowed by law and meets the strict rules that are in place to protect your privacy.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, wait: Who are these researchers? When has this happened in the past? Who are the researchers you have in mind for the future? If I find out you&#8217;ve sold a bunch of care.data to a private company, will I be able to opt out then?</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t say.</p>
<p>In other news, <strong><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hospital-records-nhs-patients-insurance">The NHS sold health record information to a big insurance company</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Goldacre talks about health insurance concerns with care.data being a bit of a red herring. If you have private health insurance, you give them access to your records anyway. Right, but this is a different kettle of herring. I don&#8217;t trust the NHS not to sell this data to companies who exist to make a profit – because that is a fundamental conflict of interest. I don&#8217;t have a problem giving my own medical insurer (disclosure: I haven&#8217;t got any private health insurance) my medical history. But I <em>do</em> have a problem giving an unknown corporation access to my info.</p>
<h2>Care.data risks are not laid out.</h2>
<p>Information will be &#8220;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Pseudonymity">pseudonymised</a>,&#8221; which means that each record will be given a fake name. So Joe Bloggs will have the same medical history as me, but won&#8217;t be called Zach.</p>
<p>But, pseudonymised data has risks <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Inference_attack">(read about inference attacks)</a>. It is possible (and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AOL_search_data_scandal">it&#8217;s been done</a>) to work out the link between a pseudo-human and a real person.</p>
<p>I also wonder what the leaflet says it will do to make sure the data is securely stored. Hmm&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We are very careful with the information and we follow strict rules about how it is stored and used, and have a thorough process that must be followed before any information can be shared.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, that&#8217;s fine then. They promise to be careful with it.</p>
<p>So, I have a quick search for &#8220;NHS data leak.&#8221; What I find is <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/technology-23286231">story</a> after <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/nhs-trust-fined-175000-over-data-leak-7000002198">story</a> of bad things done with data by the NHS.</p>
<p>Is this a fair assessment? No. It&#8217;s a search of news stories using a leading query. Sorry. But I want to know about this. I want to know how the NHS will keep care.data safe, secure and out of the hands of unknown people.</p>
<p>From the way I understand it, the risks of data breaches or inference attacks tend to be small for most individuals. But they are not covered by the NHS Leaflet.</p>
<h2>Opting out is the only stone I have to throw, isn&#8217;t it?</h2>
<p>I want the NHS to look at its data more thoroughly. I want them to be able to do deep, important meta-analyses on health records, outcomes and practices. I want them to save lives through data.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t trust the way they&#8217;ve set up this scheme, and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a better option than to opt out.</p>
<p>The scheme to put the data online has been <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/health-26239532">delayed for 6 months</a>, following criticism from some important bodies (like The Royal College of GPs, the British Medical Association and patient watchdog Healthwatch England).</p>
<p>Dr. Goldacre asks us to hold fire on opting out. Wait until closer to the time, and see what happens. But I&#8217;m not a GP (Ben is), I&#8217;m not a columnist (ditto), nor am I a member of a watchdog (I don&#8217;t think owning a spaniel counts, right?) I feel that my opt-out is as close to a protest vote as I&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>Alongside this, a lot of people will forget to re-open the issue in 6 months. <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Politics_of_memory">People collectively forget things</a> – even important things. I think waiting is a bad idea because of this.</p>
<p>So, I used <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/www.faxyourgp.com">Fax Your GP</a> to opt out.</p>
<p id="update"><strong>Update, it looks like Ben Goldacre thinks it&#8217;s too much of a mess now.</strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">That really is the end of it for me. If <a href="https://twitter.com/hscic">@HSCIC</a> are still hiding info on what went wrong, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/caredata?src=hash">#caredata</a> is unsupportable <a href="http://t.co/5xPQ3dbTN3">http://t.co/5xPQ3dbTN3</a></p>
