<p>What follows is an edited version of the answer I gave there.</p>
<p>My immediate reaction was simply: &#8220;Not any more than anyone else can put aside their own experience, philosophy, intuition, insight and individual knowledge or understanding when making decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surely, when you make a particular decision you bring to bear a vast collection of understanding. Not all of this is &#8220;evidence-based&#8221; in the strict terms I believe you&#8217;re probably referring to. The same is true for a religious person and a non-religious person, because both have brains that work like people&#8217;s brains should, right? Unless you&#8217;re suggesting that the religious are somehow less than human?</p>
<p>And, why would they or anyone else want to? Is it always bad for a person to base a decision on their own experience with morals, teachings, understandings and even faith? I&#8217;m personally delighted when someone I distrust makes a decision based on something bigger than himself. It, at the very least, shows an ability to consider multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>But I began to think more about the question, and what it suggests. It seems more or less bigoted to suggest that a minority of people in the world have a monopoly on sense because they have chosen—based on their own experiences, morals, understandings, intuitions and the rest—to reject religious teaching.</p>
<p>And I know that many people who read this will immediately become cross. They&#8217;ll accuse me of saying that people who reject religion have no sense. I may get more angry comments about thinking of some atheists as religious people, and thinking of some Christians (and, indeed, people of other moral traditions) as not really religious at all. I hope that people will read the whole paragraph above, however. It&#8217;s quite a statement to suggest that anyone with a professed faith should set aside that faith whenever a political decision is made. Most people in the world do profess some form of faith, and suggesting that most of humanity is incapable of making trustworthy decisions is dangerous ground. It&#8217;s potentially elitest ground.</p>
<p>I agree—I think—that there are times when the idea of having a decision made by someone whose understanding of a situation may be compromised by their idiosyncratic state is preposterous or unpleasant. I&#8217;d find sexual tips and marriage advice from a celibate priest harder to trust than from a friend celebrating his 25th anniversary, for example. But, political decisions are, by definition, decisions involving many people, and a minister for homes and families (or whatever they&#8217;d fall under) who happens to be a celibate priest might not be a bad thing. Political decisions would demand skills like being able to see the fullest picture possible, to balance the needs of an important minority with the majority, and the ability to think clearly and take advice.</p>
<p>Then we come to &#8220;evidence&#8221;. Do you always base every decision on &#8220;evidence&#8221;? Do you double-blind, placebo-control, clinically trial every decision you make?</p>
<p>&#8220;Blimey, I need to choose one toothpaste over another, Fred. You squirt a bit of each on these sixty identical toothbrushes, and we&#8217;ll find randomly-selected volunteers to brush their teeth with one or the other, and one group using a toothbrush full of jam, and follow their progress for a year…&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course not. You bring a shared, social and cultural understanding to every decision. OK, maybe toothpaste isn&#8217;t the best example, because it is possible to gather evidence anyway. What about deciding which colour shirt to wear, or how to tie your tie? Part of this will include an individual&#8217;s convictions, faith, teachings and understandings. Can you set them aside?</p>
<p>Can you set aside your nationality, gender, culture, intuition or &#8220;gut feeling&#8221; when making any decision at all?</p>
<p>Also, how do you make a decision on a topic where &#8220;evidence&#8221; is contradictory, difficult to interpret, or simply lacking?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of the whole notion of &#8220;evidence-based &#8221; policy and medicine. I think a minister for health who believes vehemently in homeopathy or spirit-healing would be unlikely to receive my vote. But I think we&#8217;re in danger of over-stretching the meme of &#8220;evidence-based&#8221; as an adjective. It&#8217;s a cultural token amongst the moderately-well educated to indicate a trust in scientific method over tradition, marketing or simple bullshit. But that&#8217;s what it should be. It shouldn&#8217;t be stretched to include a life-style, a culture, or a token for an atheistic life.</p>
<p>I believe in evidence in every area of life where it&#8217;s possible to apply it. It&#8217;s important to make informed decisions. But I also believe that there are areas of life where &#8220;evidence&#8221; is lacking, difficult to interpret, or simply inapplicable. There is no evidence-based conclusion to why I should prefer a certain song to another, to why I may be drawn to a particular form of beauty which may bore or disgust you, to why I find solace in sunsets and fear sleeping.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t over-stretch the idea of &#8220;evidence&#8221;. It&#8217;ll lose its meaning, and eventually, it&#8217;s significance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is based on a post which appeared on formspring.me/zbeauvais</em><br />
I think the instinct—for lack of a better word—that draws people to act religiously can also affect people with no official religion. While there may be no organised creed, there is organisation in a sort of tribal way. This may be in some way related to a culture of the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Tribe">tribe</a>. It&#8217;s the same thing that allows me to identify the tribes of midwestern Christians from America by their handshake, clothing, and sociolect. It&#8217;s the instinct that makes people buy into a group mentality like Apple fanboys, football supporters, and wine snobs.</p>
<p>I believe there to be a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/New_atheism">culture</a> developing around <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Richard_Dawkins">Dawkins</a> and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Christopher_Hitchens">Hitchens</a> and others. There are events like Godless and books like <em><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1275774092&amp;sr=8-1">An Atheist&#8217;s guide to Christmas</a></em> which are somewhat organising, I suppose. Also, given the list of people who have contributed (among whom are many people I admire) I would be surprised if they don&#8217;t make compelling, interesting and probably very funny reading. But I think the compelling and funny part of the atheist culture is not part of being fundamentally against others&#8217; beliefs, or against God or &#8220;a god&#8221;. I think the idea of &#8220;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Antitheism">antitheism</a>&#8221; is a far less compelling mindset. I don&#8217;t like the idea that one sets their belief and rhetoric as an antithesis.</p>
<p>A possibly relevant illustration would be to look at this in terms of other antithesis positions, like political rhetoric based entirely on the principle of &#8220;not being them.&#8221; It makes your position one relative to the existence, status, and nature of your opposition, which I think is at least silly and at most dangerous. If I were to consider myself to be an &#8220;antiTory,&#8221; then I am simply diametrically opposed to the ideas of a party over which I have forfeited any constructive influence. What then for instance, if they do something I agree with? Being convinced for yourself that there is no god is different from setting yourself against the whole notion as the basis of your beliefs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think all people who disbelieve in God are &#8220;fundamentalist atheists.&#8221; I don&#8217;t equate a person&#8217;s belief and perspective with religiosity. What I do think is that people can religiously follow a group or concept. The word fundamentalist itself is difficult to work with. It&#8217;s something that is understood to be positive by people I wouldn&#8217;t always think of as fundamentally fundamentalist themselves. For some, the idea of being fundamental is to be true to an idea, and this is not a bad thing in itself. I can fundamentally believe it is best to to act selflessly, to edify others, and this would clearly not be negative.</p>
<p>But I think the word has been used commonly to refer to a kind of self-subsumation into the tribe, culture and ideology of a group. News reports of &#8220;fundamentalist terrorists,&#8221; which is probably unhelpful, but the word seems to convey a meaning that is useful sometimes, when talking about individuals who surrender their own perspectives to the tribe.</p>
<p>So, in a similar way to how I think of fundamentalist religious people, I would probably consider a &#8220;fundamentalist atheist&#8221; to be one who believes strongly that there is no god. One who believes that he is in a superior position for believing this way, and that those who believe otherwise are in some sense inferior (pagan, heathen, barbaric perhaps?). And, it would be a person for whom atheism fills a sociological need to belong to a tribe more than it fills the answer to a personal question about the meaning(s) of life.</p>
<p>I fully understand the desire to break free from religious thinking and teaching, and the need to feel unconstrained by a tribal group. I also understand the social desire to feel looked after, cherished and loved and affirmed by being part of something bigger than myself. These tensions are difficult to balance, and I think people find their own ways to do so. I think the balance shifting uncontrollably toward seeking the approval or support of a social group organised around a set of ideas (teaching, creed, reasoning, books and the rest) can only lead to a loss of one&#8217;s own, unique perspective. It&#8217;s a loss to the world.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>I don't believe in it. I don't know what I think about the afterlife entirely—it's not something I feel I can know; but everything I have experienced, read and encountered leads me to believe that it's the end of (at least) communication. </p>
<p>I don't believe mediums can communicate with the dead, nor that they can receive information from those who have died. I tend to think of them as either showpeople or charlatans, and feel something beyond skepticism. I think it can be dangerous to make such claims, because it plays on the vulnerable and particularly on vulnerable topics. The loss of someone we know is one of our life-story's saddest parts, and grief often overwhelms judgement: leaving us open to suggestion and trickery.</p>
<p>I think the claim is either nonsensical or despicable, and the people who make it are either vulnerable themselves or preying upon the credulous for control or money.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm not entirely sure I understand the question. It's pretty broad. </p>
<p>I think the US has things that make it what it is, some of them good, many poor; but a direct one-for-one swap would not—from my perspective—necessarily bring the benefits they might have in the US. There is, for example, a culture of respect for teachers in the US which I would have liked to have experienced here. Students, still, feel the need to listen to and obey teachers.</p>
<p>However, the things about the society which make this possible are myriad, confusing and far from straightforward. A general respect for authority does, seemingly, exist to a greater extent in the US. But the respect can also manifest as fear, as of police. I instinctively felt fearful around police officers in my home town, probably because I was stopped many times as a teenager for no offense. This has not happened since I moved to the UK, and the culture here seems to be one of the police (generally) respecting citizens.</p>
<p>This, however manifests itself in a state which imposes itself in different, less obvious ways, and a culture in education of active disrespect from students of teachers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure I understand the question. It&#8217;s pretty broad. </p>
<p>I think the US has things that make it what it is, some of them good, many poor; but a direct one-for-one swap would not—from my perspective—necessarily bring the benefits they might have in the US. There is, for example, a culture of respect for teachers in the US which I would have liked to have experienced here. Students, still, feel the need to listen to and obey teachers.</p>
<p>However, the things about the society which make this possible are myriad, confusing and far from straightforward. A general respect for authority does, seemingly, exist to a greater extent in the US. But the respect can also manifest as fear, as of police. I instinctively felt fearful around police officers in my home town, probably because I was stopped many times as a teenager for no offense. This has not happened since I moved to the UK, and the culture here seems to be one of the police (generally) respecting citizens.</p>
<p>This, however manifests itself in a state which imposes itself in different, less obvious ways, and a culture in education of active disrespect from students of teachers.</p>
<p>These are gross generalisations, but I think my most basic answer is that the differences are complex, and a simple move from one to the other couldn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Oh, except coffee&#8230; there is generally better coffee available in the US. Though, US influence has given some roasters here a good foundation for great beans too.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm not sure how to frame a response to this one...</p>
<p>I've lived in the UK for all but a few months of my voting-eligible life, and this is not the first general election I've been present for. I remember watching the Swing-o-meter and wrapping my head around marginal constituencies, door-to-door canvassing, and the implied outcome of an apathetic society turning out to be a surprisingly well-informed populous. So I'm not sure how foreign I feel, really.</p>
<p>I'd like to think I think of this election as anyone with an education and interest in the future would.</p>
<p>But what DO I think of this election? </p>
<p>I think that the parties are too strong. I watched my first Parliamentary reading a couple weeks ago, as the Digital Economy Bill became the Digital Economy Act through a process of washup and rush toward as this government hurridly tied off it's loose ends. It was the first time I delved into the Whip system, and surprised myself by how incredibly simple it is: vote the way the party agreed, or your club membership will be revoked (along with your parking permit and gym membership, I like to imagine.) I was appalled that the Members of Parliament, elected to represent the best interests of their constituents, were simply corralled to put up their hands at the right minute, then sauntered off again to continue canvassing. I knew this kind of behaviour existed (I've seen Yes, Minister), but I wasn't aware just how BAD and SHABBY the whole process appears. </p>
<p>There are three clubs, all fighting a terrifyingly expensive popularity contest: all struggling to appear the most like someone You and I might want to be friends with. None seems to realise, of course, that You and Me are different, have widely divergent lives, tastes and perspectives; and that none has a chance in hell of appealing completely to both You and Me, so they split the vast differences by trying to appear as least like someone both of us might hate. The result being very little substantial discusion of policy and potential consequences of slightly-different political machines, with the focus going instead to well-rehearsed catchphrases. </p>
<p>Individual MP's are discouraged from standing out, and indeed, probably don't want to for fear of coming under intense pressure from their Whip, the tabloid press or Jeremy Paxman. This is illustrated by the fact that my local MP, a Mr. Phillip Dunne (Conservative), replied to my concerned letter with one which was identical to one sent out to a friend from a different constituency. Indeed, his letter expressing his concern and the evils of a future Labour government was a replica—verbatum—of one sent to many others across the country. Writing to your MP is like asking for a copy of a printed policy list. </p>
<p>None of the parties seems to exist in the present world. It doesn't seem to have occurred to them that someone might, for example, Google a few lines from their heartfelt letter to find thousands of results showing the same words coming back to them; because the Labour MP's did exactly the same thing. It's all a reflection of committees to which we're not invited.</p>
<p>The parties seem to be driven by a somewhat shadowy aristocracy, and the well-connected and powerful of the world are as present here as they are in other "democracies": Murdoch, Mandelson, and other kingmakers. But I think the real problem is that we're all asked to choose between three closed-door groups. </p>
<p>We could perhaps make a difference to the future of the country by joining one of these groups, I suppose. I guess if enough "normal" people were to be well-enough qualified to raise informed objections, and listen to the other sides of problems; we might, slowly etch our own individual influence into the fabric of our particular club. But we won't, mostly. Because we're already occupied with the choices we've made, and we don't feel particularly drawn to a life of defending our view under ever-increasing scrutiny. The clubs attract the clubby, so we shouldn't be surprised that most politicians appear similar. They're a self-selected population of like-minded or like-skilled individuals, and the outcome is a similar-seeming facade.</p>
<p>That sounds extremely cynical, like it doesn't matter what we do. I don't believe that's true, but I do believe that the system's various checks, balances and inertias prevent us from impacting it very heavily.</p>
<p>Maybe this heavy machinery is a good thing. Maybe they stop radicalisation and the "balance" may be some sort of stabiliser? </p>
<p>So, I'm not sure WHAT to think about this election. Judging from the conversations I've had with colleagues and friends, and from the perspectives on programmes, I'm guessing that's not a particularly foreign state of mind, either.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>I don't see history as linearly-progressive. I believe we learn much from our past, and value history. Our story is an accumulation of our thoughts, our lives and our predecessors' ways of living: and it contains many, many truths. We don't always learn from the past, and often forget what used to be known. There have been many darker periods in our stories when we acted foolishly despite the "progress" of generations. So, I do not see any thought as "outmoded," especially in the context of its time. That's not to say I don't think some things should change (we SHOULD learn from our past), and so learn to treat women as equals—a lesson we still have not learned—to be careful with our resources, and to test practices to see which ring true (i.e. homeopathic remedies).</p>
<p>Nor do I see the Enlightenment period as anything that was a total disregard of religious thought. I am not an expert, and most of my historical interest lies further back (I love reading/learning about Anglo-Saxon England, for example), so I'm probably not very well qualified to answer your question. But that period is full of beautiful writing and interesting ways of thinking (such as existentialism). Some even embraced traditional stories and truths (Søren Kierkegaard, for example). So, different ways of thinking took a precedent over past, but no total divorce occurred.</p>
<p>I have a difficult time with the tone of this question, I must confess. It feels superior, as if we (or he/she for having asked it) is so much better than our predecessors. We've conquered religion! We don't need to "cling to outmoded ways".</p>
<p>It sounds hubristic. </p>
<p>We live in a world where we are slowly destroying our own climate through greed and disregard. We, in the past 100 years, have amassed more than enough destructive power to obliterate the surface of our planet. We fight open-ended wars with remote-controlled devices and fill our minds with thoughts of fear, and death, and destruction. We are less egalitarian than many civilisations from our past: looking back at the Saxons, who—even owning slaves—seem somehow less politically crippled than we seem to be now. We watch gladiatorial displays in which losers are humiliated and scorned and winners enthroned, for a short time, in our media and consciousnesses. We grow enough food to feed the planet and more, yet people starve, and the difference between the world's richest and poorest seems bigger than at any time in our story. And, for the first time in decades, we are leaving our children with fewer years to live than ourselves.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I don't see this current reality as superior to all that's past, and I don't rush to disregard something because it is not currently fashionable.</p>
<p>I hope that we do learn, and that we learn to dismantle the structures of religion which allow terrible things to happen behind sacredly-closed doors. And I hope power people wield through controlling thoughts and feelings as with religious dogma lessens.</p>
<p>But I do cling to many ways of thinking. I don't think the world would be better without faith. Without the embodiment of Love, nor the teachings of selfless giving I learned as a kid.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>I don't know, sounds like a clinical trial might be in order?</p>
<p>I'm uncomfortable with the idea of religion, and that discomfort is growing into something akin to distrust. </p>
<p>I sort of see "religion" as a way to organise faith and belief into a structure. Traditionally, this structure has been a default in many cultures—because the organised belief and faith were heavily integrated into the social structures too. In the West, this tradition has become eroded. I don't see this as bad in itself. It may prove to be hugely good, because it makes a person's faith their own responsibility and maybe allows for a stronger connection with Love. Religion can get in the way of faith, and in the way of Love, especially if the structure of the religion is particularly authoritarian or the ideas closely controlled.</p>
<p>I do believe in a loving, creative God, and I follo the teachings of Jesus, but I'm uncomfortable with the structures and manifestations of "religion". The way I see it, I think, is that if God is infinite and also benign (Loving), then those who want to Love, and those who question will ultimately find Love somehow. Religion might limit this questioning, and limit our own understanding of Love.</p>
<p>That't not to say I don't see truth in religious teaching, or that I am a complete non-traditionalist (my instinct is to embrace tradition, though my conscious thought is conflicted where I don't see the truth in a tradition). Some traditions are good, or contain good or are useful or are beautiful. I think the ones which are narrative rather than proscriptive are most close to Love, at least for me.</p>
<p>So, I might surprise you by saying perhaps a religious person can hide behind an institutionalised version of the truth to justify not thinking for themselves?</p>
<p>Oh, I also think many athiests can be "religious" themselves, by the way. If the profound belief that nothing beyond their potential state of empirical knowledge becomes a structure, then it resembles nothing more than religious thought-laziness. So, be athiest, be religious, but don't hide behind either. Be you, and I pray you find Love.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know, sounds like a clinical trial might be in order?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m uncomfortable with the idea of religion, and that discomfort is growing into something akin to distrust. </p>
<p>I sort of see &#8220;religion&#8221; as a way to organise faith and belief into a structure. Traditionally, this structure has been a default in many cultures—because the organised belief and faith were heavily integrated into the social structures too. In the West, this tradition has become eroded. I don&#8217;t see this as bad in itself. It may prove to be hugely good, because it makes a person&#8217;s faith their own responsibility and maybe allows for a stronger connection with Love. Religion can get in the way of faith, and in the way of Love, especially if the structure of the religion is particularly authoritarian or the ideas closely controlled.</p>
<p>I do believe in a loving, creative God, and I follo the teachings of Jesus, but I&#8217;m uncomfortable with the structures and manifestations of &#8220;religion&#8221;. The way I see it, I think, is that if God is infinite and also benign (Loving), then those who want to Love, and those who question will ultimately find Love somehow. Religion might limit this questioning, and limit our own understanding of Love.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>The iPad is something I'm more curious about than lustful for. I want to see how it works, how it feels to use and what difference it'll make to the way I do things.</p>
<p>I'll be interested to see how it does at conferences, for example. Whether the format of a tablet is a useful thing to have due to weight and room. </p>
<p>Also, I want to see how media is rendered and if it really does change anything about the way I interact with content.</p>
<p>So, not hugely badly, but I'll be happy to try it out. I imagine it might grow on  me though.</p>
