					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;heh... I guess anything with &quot;Windows&quot; in it is essentially trollbait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know exactly what &quot;joebob&quot; means by &quot;not even any problems with programs crashing.&quot; or, more generally: &quot;in thebeta so far,&quot;. Does he mean that among the entire Windows 7 Beta testing community, there has not been a single BSOD? I can vouch for several &quot;programs crashing&quot; in MY install, including the new IE8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ll have to see how well Windows 7 does. I hope it&#039;s very stable and fast. I&#039;m an OS X fan, and I don&#039;t want Apple to rest on its Vista-beating laurels. Linux is also great, though I&#039;ve given up time and again on desktop distros due to simply not wanting to go through the learning curve yet again. (That and the constant terminal-bashing and hardware lack-of-support)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, though, Anything about Windows and Mac is trollbait to someone.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Oh NOes! Windows gives me more options to configure my system than a mac! Oh, wait... that&#039;s a good thing. The thing with macs are that Aplle has full control over the hardware and the OS, microsoft on the other hand has to make their OS work with countless combinations of hardware. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As For BSODs, there have been no BSODs in thebeta so far, not even any problems with programs crashing, and for allthe microsoft bashing mactards, vista has been roc solid, which is more that I can say about the 6 G5 systems we have at work, which crash about once a day.... if we are lucky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sales guys have also moved back to windows notebooks from the macbooks they bought. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux is for people who are realy smart, Macs are for people who &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they are realy smart, windows is for people who want to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sorry - clear case of RTFA ;)
I guess once you have a recognised symbol of doom such as the BSOD, messing with it may be akin to putting roller skates on Cthulhu?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of 4OD, has the Kangaroo project died a death? I heard that Virgin, Joost and a couple of others are seeking to ban it...&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;@rob, Oh, I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll still BSODâ€”It&#039;s still Windowsâ€”and I didn&#039;t give it its paces by any means. I didn&#039;t run anything app-intensive, nor did I do any benchmarking (even by rule of thumb). This was a feeling-only look, very unscientific ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s not parallels, though... it&#039;s Bootcamp, so it&#039;s a full install, running natively. The only difference is that it&#039;s on nice hardware with a 64bit chipset, using a few Apple plugins (to make the keyboard talk to the hardware, since the MBP hasn&#039;t got volume switches etc...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#039;d have thought, however, that they could find a better colour death-screen, even just or the Beta.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Seems a little perverse testing it on parallels huh? Seriously though, Gizmodo are claimimg the first BSOD, but I reckon they&#039;re probably just shouting the loudest:&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[Zach,

There&#039;s a point you&#039;ve missed.  It isn&#039;t Vista.  But really, it isn&#039;t Vista.  It doesn&#039;t have a name, it has a number, because it isn&#039;t Vista.

However, Windows 7 will be good to great on a huge variety of hardware, and running applications from the early 90&#039;s onwards.  That&#039;s what it&#039;s for.  It isn&#039;t OS X, and Microsoft don&#039;t want it to be.

I&#039;ll wait to see how it goes.  On my Mac, of course!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just noticed another review (of a slightly earlier build) by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes over on ZD Net (http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=3223), where he talks a bit more about the Taskbar. I think he&#039;s spot-on:

&quot;Oddly enough, the first thing that youâ€™re likely to notice about Windows 7 is also the bit that I like the least. The new revamped taskbar is visually very interesting (and certainly a lot easier to use at higher screen resolutions that the Vista or XP taskbar), but it tries to do too much and as such comes across as kludgey and counter-intuitive. One failure is that itâ€™s hard to tell the difference between apps that are running and shortcuts that have been pinned to the taskbar. It also incorporates the new Jump Lists feature which acts as a context-sensitive menu for applications. Problem is that thereâ€™s very little rhyme or reason to what to expect from Jump Lists, making them awkward to use in the real world.&quot;]]></description>
