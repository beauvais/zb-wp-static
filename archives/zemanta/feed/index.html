					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Yes, we looked into dbpedia, but in the end we use something called wikiprep - wikiprep.sf.net that we help codevelop that allows us to do similar things to dbpedia or even better. I&#039;m not exactly sure why, but my engineers tell me that there are good technical reasons for doing this our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, we fixed the jumping bug earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It is a bit &quot;raw&quot; yet, but I really like it.  I never posted pictures with my posts BZ (before zemanta) - but I find myself really trying hard to find a good one now.  Good mini-review.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi Jure,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the fast comment, and I look forward to seeing how everything works together in future. Have you thought of using DBPedia instead of Wikipedia for your source? It should have a stronger metadata structure, which might make it easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi, thanks for trying us out. The license is done in a way because Wikipedia/Wikimedia commons don&#039;t have good metadata for all the images, so we can&#039;t really tell you. What we can tell you is that you have to go to that page and read the license for yourself. There are a number of people working on making this better (including ourselves) so in the future you&#039;ll see less and less of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the jumping of cursor, this is clearly a bug and we&#039;ll fix this as soon as we hunt it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for you comments, we&#039;re working on addressing all the things you&#039;ve pointed out. This is our second release after the one at the end of March, so hopefully we&#039;ll have something even better in next few weeks for another a bit less major upgrade (of course we&#039;ll fix things like cursor jumping sooner).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jure Cuhalev, Zemanta&lt;/p&gt;
