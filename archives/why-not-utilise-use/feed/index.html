					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Before I forget, I also meant to make another comment about using vocabulary to avoid repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we think about a process of writing where a thesaurus is used to avoid repetition in a revisited concept, then it occurs to me that we can reverse that procedure to work out what a passage is discussing. If each word is mapped to all of the thesaurus &quot;word groups&quot; it appears in, then a paragraph can be mapped into a histogram of these groups. Each group of words in a thesaurus loosely describes a concept, so a histogram like this would describe the concepts referenced by the paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, some of the meanings that show up are irrelevant, since words can have very different meaning in different contexts. However, this is where the english avoidance of repetition helps us.Â While individual words may have different meanings in different contexts, their synonyms won&#039;t usually share the same set of meanings. So the unintended concepts should not show up very often (unless the same word is being overused), while the intended semantics should appear as a spike in the histogram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a particularly precise method of detecting meaning in a document, it would nevertheless be easy to do, and potentially useful for comparing large groups of documents for ideas that are common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the idea for this about 10 years ago while learning about indexing video systems (these indexes are usually built with vectors in a similar way). I always meant to implement it, but it&#039;s stayed on the back burner for a long time. Perhaps it&#039;s time to try it out and see how effective it is. Â :-)&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;While I agree to an extent, I also think that it depends on context. Newspaper articles are written with an emphasis on economy of language. Overly elaborate vocabulary should be eschewed in that context, even at the expense of occasional pleonasm. However, for an essay or a novel there is an expectation of some embellishment. If a novelist were to use the word &quot;said&quot; every single time (perhaps interspersed with &quot;asked&quot; where appropriate), then I would find the writing very flat.
Personally, I&#039;m not a fan of &quot;utilise&quot; in either written or spoken english. Similarly, &quot;orientate&quot; annoys me quite a bit, when &quot;orient&quot; means exactly the same thing. They both remind me of the &quot;corporate jargon&quot; that you referred to, though I find your other complains, along with the verbing of nouns to be far more egregious. The latter seem like an attempt to sound sophisticated in the use of language, while actually demonstrating the opposite. In that sense, I&#039;m a little more forgiving of the use of words with historical acceptance such as &quot;utilise&quot;, and more upset with terms like &quot;to action&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, disgust at the abuse of language is a losing battle. Languages (especially English) evolve, as they must. After all, we regularly discuss ideas today that 50 years ago could not have been conceived of. The purpose of language is to communicate, so whatever the majority hold to be acceptable is really what a language has become. I just find it frustrating to watch it go in a direction that is unnecessary (due to existing vocabulary and grammar) and annoying (in the way it breaks existing structure and rules, while pretending to be more urbane). Blog posts like this one are great for helping me to vent some of that frustration. Â :-)&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi Paul, thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that&#039;s a good point about repetition and vocabulary in English. English is a huge language and it&#039;s happy to use words it&#039;s stolen pretty promiscuously. It has amassed many more words than other languages, and it&#039;s a shame not to use its more inspiring words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I think that some words we use regularly can be repeated quite a bit without notice. An example would be &quot;said&quot; which is used in virtually any report. Here&#039;s one from the front page of today&#039;s Guardian: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&#039;Clegg said: &quot;I think we&#039;ve already got an agreement Jeremy Hunt will go to the Leveson pretty quick.&quot; Leveson&#039;s spokesman said that Hunt&#039;s request&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that short story, &quot;said&quot; appears 9 times. Unless the reporter uses something more evocativeâ€”&#039;Clegg exclaimed: &quot;I think...&quot;&#039;â€”the emphasis is on the content of the quote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this applies to words like utilise and &quot;to action&quot; in a similar way. We can avoid repetition by using fascinating phrases where the content is interesting without utilising jargon that highlights what simply isn&#039;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the word &quot;use&quot; 6 times above.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;While I agree in general, I do think there are exceptions where these alternatives are appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is usually considered poor style, when writing in English, to reuse the same words over and over. Consequently, during the course of a paragraph you will often see synonyms of a word as the writer tries to avoid a repetitive &quot;sound&quot; (so to speak). Personally, I think that this is the most common use that people have for thesauri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how common this is across languages. I suspect that English is one of the few languages with this idiosyncrasy, as I&#039;ve often heard that English is unusual in that it allows so many ways of describing the same thing. For instance, the Japanese have a very specific way to say things, and have a great deal of difficulty understanding that English can say the same thing in a multitude of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
