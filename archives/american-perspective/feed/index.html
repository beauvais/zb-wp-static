					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Yes, to an extent, some of us do view socialism, liberalism, and progressivism (my, a lot of isms there) as inherently destructive to our way of life. Two years ago however, slightly more than half of the us thought it was worthwhile to vote strongly to our left politically. Now we have voted almost the opposite direction. I think politically and in every other way the us can be described as a people of extremes. This could be from media influence, or a side effect of taking our country in blood, and holding it for over two hundred years in blood. We are a complicated people, and it is impossible to tell how we will all react to any given circumstance. For instance, in some places in the south, a stranger is greeted and offered a meal. In the same town, the same stranger is met by a different family and met with a shotgun and an order to get off their land. Closer to home for you, my dear brother, is the wild difference I have seen in people raised in pueblo west vs pueblo. On average, the pueblo native walks with their head down, avoiding eye contact with everyone, and appears somewhat fearful of others. Ampueblo west native walks with their head up encouraging eye contact with all they meet and is happy to start or engage in a conversation. Pueblo westians are also more likely to be conservative while puebloans are likely to be progressive, socialist, liberal. (Take your pick or language on that one. It all means the same to us.) &lt;/p&gt;
