					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;hmmm
I first thought £3 was a lot until I tried making my own &quot;graze box&quot;... Sure, you can just about make it cheaper but you miss out on a few of the main benefits the £3 brings. First, you&#039;ve essentially outsourced the job. It adds a structure to which you can subscribe. I know my lunch will be there now, and the alternative is £3 for a terrible sandwich anyway. Additionally, the benefit of having a random selection with weighted options for things I like means that I get a bit of a surprise. If I buy the same kinds of foods from the shop, in order to stay under my £3/day, I have to eat the same selection for about three days. So, yes: £3 for a handful of nuts is a lot of money; but that&#039;s not what I bought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree about the feel-good value. Fortunately, I tend to actually like a lot of the feel-good foods. Fresh fruit and oats and suchlike are great! Not sure about Wheatabix, though... that&#039;s just edible bricks...&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve had a look at the Graze box and I think £3 for a handful of nuts is extortionate! Next time you&#039;re in the supermarket doing your weekly shop, why not drop in some fresh fruit and nuts, and pop a few in a Tupperware pot each morning? Still - if it means you don&#039;t skip lunch and stops you troughing when you get home, it&#039;s £3 well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#062;I feel better, because this food is actually, truly great for me and It feels nice to eat something light but sustaining when sitting at a desk for hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s nice when you get that &quot;I can tell this is doing me good&quot; feeling. I get it when I&#039;ve finished a bowl of Shredded Wheat, even though it&#039;s clearly straw. It feels like it&#039;s cleaning your body from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;
