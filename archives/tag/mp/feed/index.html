				<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm not sure how to frame a response to this one...</p>
<p>I've lived in the UK for all but a few months of my voting-eligible life, and this is not the first general election I've been present for. I remember watching the Swing-o-meter and wrapping my head around marginal constituencies, door-to-door canvassing, and the implied outcome of an apathetic society turning out to be a surprisingly well-informed populous. So I'm not sure how foreign I feel, really.</p>
<p>I'd like to think I think of this election as anyone with an education and interest in the future would.</p>
<p>But what DO I think of this election? </p>
<p>I think that the parties are too strong. I watched my first Parliamentary reading a couple weeks ago, as the Digital Economy Bill became the Digital Economy Act through a process of washup and rush toward as this government hurridly tied off it's loose ends. It was the first time I delved into the Whip system, and surprised myself by how incredibly simple it is: vote the way the party agreed, or your club membership will be revoked (along with your parking permit and gym membership, I like to imagine.) I was appalled that the Members of Parliament, elected to represent the best interests of their constituents, were simply corralled to put up their hands at the right minute, then sauntered off again to continue canvassing. I knew this kind of behaviour existed (I've seen Yes, Minister), but I wasn't aware just how BAD and SHABBY the whole process appears. </p>
<p>There are three clubs, all fighting a terrifyingly expensive popularity contest: all struggling to appear the most like someone You and I might want to be friends with. None seems to realise, of course, that You and Me are different, have widely divergent lives, tastes and perspectives; and that none has a chance in hell of appealing completely to both You and Me, so they split the vast differences by trying to appear as least like someone both of us might hate. The result being very little substantial discusion of policy and potential consequences of slightly-different political machines, with the focus going instead to well-rehearsed catchphrases. </p>
<p>Individual MP's are discouraged from standing out, and indeed, probably don't want to for fear of coming under intense pressure from their Whip, the tabloid press or Jeremy Paxman. This is illustrated by the fact that my local MP, a Mr. Phillip Dunne (Conservative), replied to my concerned letter with one which was identical to one sent out to a friend from a different constituency. Indeed, his letter expressing his concern and the evils of a future Labour government was a replica—verbatum—of one sent to many others across the country. Writing to your MP is like asking for a copy of a printed policy list. </p>
<p>None of the parties seems to exist in the present world. It doesn't seem to have occurred to them that someone might, for example, Google a few lines from their heartfelt letter to find thousands of results showing the same words coming back to them; because the Labour MP's did exactly the same thing. It's all a reflection of committees to which we're not invited.</p>
<p>The parties seem to be driven by a somewhat shadowy aristocracy, and the well-connected and powerful of the world are as present here as they are in other "democracies": Murdoch, Mandelson, and other kingmakers. But I think the real problem is that we're all asked to choose between three closed-door groups. </p>
<p>We could perhaps make a difference to the future of the country by joining one of these groups, I suppose. I guess if enough "normal" people were to be well-enough qualified to raise informed objections, and listen to the other sides of problems; we might, slowly etch our own individual influence into the fabric of our particular club. But we won't, mostly. Because we're already occupied with the choices we've made, and we don't feel particularly drawn to a life of defending our view under ever-increasing scrutiny. The clubs attract the clubby, so we shouldn't be surprised that most politicians appear similar. They're a self-selected population of like-minded or like-skilled individuals, and the outcome is a similar-seeming facade.</p>
<p>That sounds extremely cynical, like it doesn't matter what we do. I don't believe that's true, but I do believe that the system's various checks, balances and inertias prevent us from impacting it very heavily.</p>
<p>Maybe this heavy machinery is a good thing. Maybe they stop radicalisation and the "balance" may be some sort of stabiliser? </p>
<p>So, I'm not sure WHAT to think about this election. Judging from the conversations I've had with colleagues and friends, and from the perspectives on programmes, I'm guessing that's not a particularly foreign state of mind, either.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple weeks ago, I wrote to my MP to raise concern for the so-called &#8220;washup&#8221; of last-minute legislation being used to push through the now highly-controversial &#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/digital-economy-bill">Digital Economy Bill</a>.&#8221; </p>
<p>My reasons to write are several, and I will devote some more time to explain these later, but wanted to post my MP&#8217;s response verbatim (my address removed only.)</p>
<p>###<br />
Philip Dunne, MP Ludlow</p>
<p>23rd March 2010</p>
<p>Dear Zach,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email of March 17th regarding extreme internet laws.</p>
<p>For nearly twelve years, the Government has neglected this crucial area of our economy. We believe a huge amount needs to be done to give the UK a modern regulatory environment for the digital and creative industries. Whilst we welcome aspects of the bill there are other areas of great concern to us.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that Britain has the most favourable intellectual framework in the world for innovators, digital content creators and high tech businesses. We recognise the need to tackle digital piracy and make it possible for people to buy and sell digital intellectual property online. However, it is vital that any anti-piracy measures promote new business models rather than holding innovation back. THis must not be about propping up existing business models but creating an environment that allows new ones to develop. That is why we were opposed to original clause 17 and are still opposed to clause 29 which props up ITV regional news with BBC License Fee payers money.</p>
<p>The Government&#8217;s failure to introduce the Bill until the eleventh hour of this Parliament has given rise to considerable concern that we no longer have the time to scrutinise the many controversial and detailed measures outlined in their proposals. We fully appreciate these concerns. However in certain areas, including measures to allow website blocking in certain carefully proscribed circumstances, there has been substantial debate in the House of Lords. I also believe they should be debated in the House of Commons before we agree to them. Only if we are confident that they have been given scrutiny that they deserve will we support them.</p>
<p>IT is also worth pointing out that many of the fears about the Bill&#8217;s proposals are not entirely accurate. People won&#8217;t be discunnected from the internet without due process. And it will only be a small minority of people who consistently infringe copyright who are disconnected, not the average person who happens to have done so once or twice. Even then, they may be able to reconnect using another ISP immediately and without penalty.</p>
<p>Please rest assured that my colleagues in the Shadow Culture, Media and Sport and Shadow Business, Innovation and Skills teams will do everything in their power to work towards legislation that strengthens our digital sector and provides the security that our businesses and consumers so desperately need.</p>
<p>Thank you again for taking the time to get in touch.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Philip Dunne<br />
MP for Ludlow</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 5px;" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2246655124_22fb2c92ac_m.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="home secretary" width="300" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>At lunch time today, I learned from a tweet that UK Home Secretary, the Right Honorable Jacqui Smith will resign as soon as convenient to the Prime Minister. Most sources seem to cite the now cliched &#8220;expenses scandal&#8221; as the main reason, but also mention various moments of Home Secretarial <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/article6001447.ece">chagrin</a>.</p>
<p>My initial reaction was one of elation. &#8220;Finally, and not too soon!&#8221; is a sentence too easily thought about someone I think has done more to damage the UK than any one holding power in the last decade.</p>
<p>But this is not how I want her to be remembered. I do not want her to have gone because of a media-fueled feeding frenzy of shame for her <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/jacqui-smith-television-expenses">expenses</a> or her husband&#8217;s use of public funding to watch porn.</p>
<p>Maybe I should clarify?</p>
<p>Last February, I wrote a <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/jacqui-smiths-new-immigration-measures-are-a-pointless-gesture/">piece about the Home Secretary</a> which still attracts concerned comments. It told my story of how her tough stand on immigration affects the legitimate, the law-abiding, and the defenseless rather than dealing with any perceived threat by illegal immigrants, migrant workers, or European nationals.</p>
<p><em>Jaccui Smith should resign because she used a misleading public story to back plans which bring shame and financial hardship to people.</em></p>
<p>One of the most controversial campaigns Ms Smith backed was one to introduce compulsory ID cards to the UK. She <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7712275.stm">claimed that people would willingly sign up to such a scheme</a>, and much talk of fighting terrorism with these bits of plastic ensued. <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Millions-may-resist-database-says-poll.html">This is a lie</a>, really. People don&#8217;t want it—or, at least, the majority of people don&#8217;t seem to want to spend their money on them. Oh, yes. Not only is the scheme <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/And-the-bad-news-ID-cards-cost-2bn-more.html">hugely</a> expensive to the public, but individuals will have to buy them themselves. The card could cost £30, £60 or <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/immigrationpolicy.idcards">£93</a>, depending on which confused source reported the cost [1]. The scheme itself will cost the UK taxpayers around <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/docA_IPS_cost_report%202009_v11_BM.pdf">£5bn with an additional £375mn</a> coming from foreign nationals, who will be the first victims of the programme.</p>
<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/index.asp">The ID cards information</a> produced by the Home Office itself reads, to this linguist at least, shockingly like propaganda. It produces press releases such as <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/press-2009-05-05a.asp">this one</a>, which appear to show an eagerness which belies the fact that nearly every mention I&#8217;ve seen in media regarding the scheme has contained the word &#8220;Controversial&#8221;. It has proven so controversial, indeed, that the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/3127696.stm">latest report</a> I read showed that the Home Office seems to have changed its mind massively. This leads me to believe that the Home Office misleads, both in content and in linguistic implication through its own media.</p>
<p><em>Jacqui Smith should resign because her policy to introduce ID cards is </em><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8037085.stm"><em>not democratically supported</em></a><em>, is questionable and expensive, and her promotion of the scheme is biased and untrue.</em></p>
<p>On any <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/jacqui-smith-key-moments">number</a> of profiles trying to make sense of or <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/jacqui-smith-resignation">summarise</a> Ms. Smith&#8217;s career, another low point has been the proposal to <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7130072.stm">allow imprisonment without charge for 42-days of suspected terrorists</a>. This has proven controversial (simply search for &#8220;Jacqui Smith 42 days&#8221; to see.) and demonstrates Ms Smith&#8217;s disregard for the ancient principle of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Due_process#In_England">due process</a>. The Proposal was mercifully <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7668477.stm">scrapped</a> last year.</p>
<p><em>Jacqui Smith should resign because her principles do not include thousand-year-old fundamentals of basic citizens&#8217; rights.</em></p>
<p>Not everything undertaken by Ms Smith has been terrible. Throughout a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8079374.stm">mixed career</a>, it should be mentioned that she held her ground, proved resiliant, and handled difficulties well (until now). The Right Honourable Jacqui Smith, MP has been the UK&#8217;s first female Home Secretary, and no doubt worked very hard. However, this was expected of an MP, and a Home Secretary should handle her job well, which is why it is news when this has not been the case.</p>
<p>Ms. Smith has been forced out of office following news of the least-damaging scandal. Shame on the media for blowing out of perspective the theft of several thousand pounds in claimed expenses in the light of a proposed spend of £5bn to encumber citizens and ostracize legitimate foreign nationals. Shame on the reporting that claims her husband&#8217;s silly use of £10 to watch porn should take precedent for misleading a nation, trying to create and enforce draconian laws and damaging the reputation of a great democracy.</p>
[1]: It should be noted that the £93 claim is old, and that the Home Office seems to say most recently that the cards will cost £30 for early adopters and rise to £60 after two years.</p>
<p>Additional ID Card Stories include: <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7736588.stm">Scotland refuses to back them.</a>, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/article587163.ece">and some initial concern about the cost raised by the LSE</a>.</p>
