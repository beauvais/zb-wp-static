								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently asked a very interesting question via <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/zbeauvais">formspring</a>. An anonymous person asked me:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the ability to &#8220;filter&#8221; &#8212; to absorb information from many sources and produce a useful result, quickly &#8212; is what really defines the &#8220;digital native.&#8221; Your thoughts?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Below is my response. I&#8217;d be interested in what you think.</strong></p>
<p>Interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>Ok, so this idea is pretty loaded: it&#8217;s full of meaning. &#8220;digital native&#8221; is a phrase which is semantically rich, and possibly not very precise. It sounds like the kind of topic which could have an entire book&#8217;s worth of words written to describe the meanings.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take one crack at it, though, by using a subject I better understand: linguistics.</p>
<p>In linguistics, we talk about different kinds of language users. Generally, there are native users and non-native, with many exceptions and all sorts of complications when you start looking into the ethnography of the topic. But, essentially, native language users absorb a language through their childhood (the ability to &#8220;acquire&#8221; language in this way seems to disappear around puberty), and they develop a fluency in it. Many linguists believe that this also shapes their thought patterns—i.e.: a native of English <em>thinks</em> in English in some way. Most at least agree that there is also cultural acquisition of some nature too. It&#8217;s all context.</p>
<p>Now, if I don&#8217;t speak a language and I want to learn, I can learn through what many linguists call &#8220;competencies&#8221;. The idea is, very basically, that people think and learn in different ways, so develop different tactics. So, some might have a natural tendency to learn words, grammatical forms and therefore develop strategies which allow them to learn vocabulary. Others use a communicative competency, and learn by trying to communicate rather than learn a form and learn basically through trial and error. (It&#8217;s closely tied with personality: some people are happy to make mistakes verbally, others are more happy to learn on their own etc&#8230;).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going this circuitous route, because I think the way someone learns a non-native language might be a helpful metaphor for the way people work with trends with which they&#8217;re unfamiliar. So, in this metaphor, a &#8220;digital native&#8221; will have the natural acquisition and competencies which come from existing in an online (I assume that&#8217;s at least part of what you mean by &#8220;digital, by the way) world. They&#8217;re used to many sources, ubiquitous connection, visual information on any topic instantly, multi-media content and hardware that&#8217;s actually quite complex to use. The thing is, to a native, it&#8217;s not a very conscious thing. Someone born into an interconnected world would be more frustrated with NOT being able to find out about anything, about not having some form of connection to information and by being unable to understand their hardware. Filtering information is less of a conscious act and more of a subconscious process. They live in a very full world, so they have already developed ways to work with all this information.</p>
<p>You might see more clearly the idea of native and non-native through different competencies, and perhaps whether the way someone thinks and frames their conscious efforts are affected by the presence of connection. Does a &#8220;digital native&#8221; think to try terribly hard to remember someone&#8217;s phone number, working out some sort of pneumonic or rhythm to memorise it? Or would they only have to if their connection were severed?</p>
<p>So, this is a long road to one context in which filtering might be a part of the competency of a &#8220;digital native&#8221;. I don&#8217;t, however, think it&#8217;s definitive; any more than saying someone who can pronounce the &#8220;th&#8221; sound is therefore defined as a &#8220;Native of English&#8221;. There are myriad concepts which are begged to be explored in the idea of being a native anything: context, competencies, aspirations, metaphorical constructs etc etc etc. But, I think the idea that someone born into a community which has lots of information will develop a certain fluency in dealing with it. They might think differently, or simply have had the tools in their &#8220;hands&#8221; for longer—moving from conscious cerebral thought about information to more subconscious, automatic use of digital tools. Filtering, in this construct, is a competency—a skillset and general tendency of a digital world. Natives would be better, non-natives would have to learn by comparing with their own skills and adapting.</p>
<p>But, I think the phrase &#8220;digital native&#8221; could be too full of loosely-encoded meaning to be very precise, or even useful without a wider, shared understanding of what you mean by it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are we, as a society or set of societies too quick to categorise?</p>
<p>I think we have built upon the Victorian-era&#8217;s predilection for classification for understanding. You&#8217;ll notice, no doubt, that I categorised the idea of classification as Victorian. Perhaps this is a helpful metaphorical conduit for expressing a large number of semantic nuances&#8211;a sort of communicative shorthand. When I mention &#8216;Victorian&#8217;, loads of images appear in my mind: women in petticoats and parasols, men with mustaches, steam engines, industrial buildings, red-brick, tea, lack of smiles&#8230; and a corresponding set of ideas begins to emerge rather like a tag-cloud which gets more intricate the longer you focus on a single tag.</p>
<p>But, what if this becomes a hindrance to meaning. I am not alone in experiencing the frustration involved when someone tries to categorise you. My wife, a veterinary surgeon, was recently introducing herself to a middle-aged woman who had asked us how long we&#8217;d lived in our town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I recently got a job in the vet&#8217;s practice,&#8221; says my wife (who&#8217;s blessed with ageless looks which often leave people stunned to learn her real age)</p>
<p>&#8220;Really! Do you need some sort of qualification to do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Both my wife and I had to bite back any reproach involved in explaining that it does indeed take quite a bit of training and qualification before being allowed to take a job as a practicing veterinary surgeon, the last of which being five-years&#8217; worth of 40+-hour weeks of a veterinary degree and harrowing RCVS examinations.</p>
<p>What the woman was trying to do, of course, was to find out whether Wendy works there as a nurse or sweeping floors and cleaning kennels. Her surprise proved this when Wendy laughingly explained that she&#8217;s a vet and therefore has several necessary qualifications.</p>
<p>What this illustrates is a time when the categories we use as a conceptual structure don&#8217;t fit. The woman&#8217;s whole perception of my wife came to a crashing, embarrassing end when she was forced to re-render her conceptual structure. Now, I believe that we, as humans, require certain conceptual and metaphorical constructs in order to turn our perceptions into understandings. They, in essence, allow us to contain a concept in order to analyse it and let our <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/Abstract_structure">abstract processes work</a>. They give non-physical concepts substance so we can get our physical brains around them. (For more, I highly recommend Lakoff and Johnson&#8217;s <em><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1207396962&amp;sr=8-1">Metaphors we Live By</a>).</em></p>
<p>What I am beginning to wonder is whether there is a glitch in the natural necessity for these constructs. What happens if a society becomes transfixed with its own metaphors? Or, maybe it&#8217;s just that the shorthand is used too freely? What does it mean to be &#8216;post-modern&#8217;, &#8216;ecological&#8217;, &#8216;ethical&#8217;, or any number of tags we use to convey huge propositions of meaning? I propose that conceptual tagging, and the short-hand language of metaphor is fast becoming the newest form of cliche. We are learning, culturally, to package more meaning than we understand ourselves into ever-smaller packages. Communication is beginning to break down at some levels due to ambiguity and a lack of understanding so that the entire semantic package is not necessarily being transmitted.</p>
<p>If I am having a conversation about industriousness, working hard, or innovation, I use the idea of &#8216;Victorian&#8217; in a very different way from its use in a dialogue about expressive freedom, colonialism or interior design. So, to a certain extent, the context of the conversation is important. But what is actually happening when someone uses &#8216;toxins&#8217;, &#8216;carbs&#8217;, and &#8216;omega-3&#8217; as tags for &#8216;unhealthy&#8217;, &#8216;bad for you&#8217;, and &#8216;beneficial&#8217; respectively? I&#8217;d love to understand this phenomenon of communication more fully.</p>
<p>Please note: I am not attacking culture, education or the general state of the world, but trying to explore the concepts of understanding and communication. If you have ideas, please let me know them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have subscribed to Tim Ferriss&#8217; blog for a few weeks, and have found its content enlightening and interesting. Having done a degree in applied linguistics, I found the his item about <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/how-to-learn-but-not-master-any-language-in-1-hour-plus-a-favor">learning a language in an hour</a> interesting, if slightly mis-named.</p>
<p>Tim reckons that you can work out how to learn a language in about an hour, but not actually become fluent in it in that time. He lays out a plan for analysing and comparing differences between languages we might already know with a target language, and using that information to make decisions about how to learn.</p>
<p>As part of my studies at Kings, we looked at learning styles and communicative competencies. (Check out <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1">George Yule</a> for more on linguistics). I would have thought that the idea that you can focus on a particular tactic for learning a language lies partly with the language itself (and for that, Tim&#8217;s blog entry seems completely apt), but also on identifying one&#8217;s own learning styles and techniques. Then, a language could be tackled in a way which makes use of one&#8217;s particular strengths while focusing on the areas which would most help.</p>
<p>I recommend Tim&#8217;s blog, and think it&#8217;s well worth a few hours reading!</p>
