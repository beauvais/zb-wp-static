								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Describing a company or concept as &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; is so, last half-decade. Nevermind that most people still haven&#8217;t heard the phrase. If you don&#8217;t believe me, go ahead and poll your office or family: unless you&#8217;re not allowed out of the IT dungeon or your family all work as tech-bloggers, my guess is that they haven&#8217;t heard or don&#8217;t understand the term.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really surprising. If you hear about a &#8220;new internet phenomenon&#8221; on mainstream news, the chances are it&#8217;s either on it&#8217;s way out or is so firmly entrenched as to be unremarkable. For a perfect example of this, look up &#8216;Facebook&#8217; in a national publication and note the language used to describe it&#8217;s shiny-new cover&#8211;regardless of the fact that most people reading this blog will have been on Facebook (or gone off Facebook) at least a year ago!</p>
<p>It even now seems that there may be a financial impact on describing your new startup as &#8220;web 2.0&#8221;. According to <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/in-case-you-missed-it-web-20-is-bad-now">Mashable!</a>, several VC&#8217;s are stating quite clearly that they won&#8217;t back Web 2.0. I have also noticed talk of bubbles breaking and &#8216;meteoric rises&#8217; with the implication that it won&#8217;t last very much longer. So many potential break-throughs won&#8217;t see their funding if they&#8217;re too 2.0.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is firmly entrenched in &#8216;techy&#8217; social networks like Digg. When I dugg a news story about the semantic web, I noticed the overwhelming majority of comments were along the lines of &#8220;semantic web is so cliche&#8221;, or &#8220;Watch out, here comes Semantic Web 2.0, Run!&#8221;. Semantic web is a term which has only been widely used recently (relative to &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; which was popularised by web stalwart <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/what-is-web-20.html">O&#8217;Reilly</a> Way back in 2005) and is already met with derision and sarcastic scorn.</p>
<p>To some extent, I think this is a good thing. If VC&#8217;s and financial backers are waking up to this, it means there might be more competition for funding and an increase in the quality of online startups. It might also mean some updates and refreshing of already-started-ups. While techy scorn is easy to find and probably doesn&#8217;t mean too much, the reality behind the bluster might just be the next set of updates to real users&#8217; online experiences. Oh, and don&#8217;t try calling it &#8220;Web 3.0&#8221;. Just don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no pleasing everyone, but it seems to me that Web 2.0 is a phenomenon which, if you&#8217;re not already using it on a daily basis (on Facebook, following Twitter, using Gmail), it&#8217;s probably better not to talk about it. Webby people will start to question your breeding and choice of apparel!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- #BeginTags --><!-- #EndTags --> For avid news readers, not much beats a classic broadsheet newspaper for quality content and writership. Although I use <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/reader">Google Reader</a> to keep up with the best of the blogs, and sometimes skim <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/www.digg.com">Digg</a> for new reads, I keep coming back to the consistent content found on traditional newspapers&#8211;online. That isn&#8217;t to say that everything found at a &#8216;proper&#8217; news site beats everything on a new media service or a blog. Indeed, many blogs have amazingly-tuned insights and offer the best rants on the planet. But, when you want general news, looking through the often opined views of one-man blogs can be a headache. Much blog content is very focused, and most Digg and Technorati articles lean towards the geeky. I landed some time ago at the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/news">Times Online</a> and frequently browse its headlines.</p>
<p>The Times Online has some of my favourite columnists and consistently high-quality comment. Who can resist a rant or opinion from <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/jeremy_clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a>? Alongside, Lord Rees-Mogg and his ilk of commentators whose opinion I have come to respect (if not always with 100% agreement!) However, I do have a few problems with the Times Online. There is, actually, only one major complaint.</p>
<h3>It is so slow!</h3>
<p>It boasts its Windows links and utilizes &#8220;Live Search&#8221; instead of Google, and I wonder if this architecture is what makes it so mind-numbingly time-consuming. Its content is well-positioned and not as graphic heavy as many sites whose load-time is much faster (check out <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/www.topgear.com">Top Gear</a> for an example of a slow site which is faster!). If you want to view many articles in a single sitting and open up multiple tabs (as I am prone to do) You will find them still loading long after you&#8217;ve made a cuppa. I find the layout pleasing, and the ease of navigating its absoultely vast content brilliant; but I can&#8217;t get over how slowly I have to navigate these pages. It also doesn&#8217;t seem to like Firefox very much (thanks Windows integration?). If you have any better news sites, let me know. It is still worth a look, though, for it simply houses some of the best news content online!</p>
