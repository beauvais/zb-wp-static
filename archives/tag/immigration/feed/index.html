								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 5px;" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2246655124_22fb2c92ac_m.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="home secretary" width="300" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>At lunch time today, I learned from a tweet that UK Home Secretary, the Right Honorable Jacqui Smith will resign as soon as convenient to the Prime Minister. Most sources seem to cite the now cliched &#8220;expenses scandal&#8221; as the main reason, but also mention various moments of Home Secretarial <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/article6001447.ece">chagrin</a>.</p>
<p>My initial reaction was one of elation. &#8220;Finally, and not too soon!&#8221; is a sentence too easily thought about someone I think has done more to damage the UK than any one holding power in the last decade.</p>
<p>But this is not how I want her to be remembered. I do not want her to have gone because of a media-fueled feeding frenzy of shame for her <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/jacqui-smith-television-expenses">expenses</a> or her husband&#8217;s use of public funding to watch porn.</p>
<p>Maybe I should clarify?</p>
<p>Last February, I wrote a <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/jacqui-smiths-new-immigration-measures-are-a-pointless-gesture/">piece about the Home Secretary</a> which still attracts concerned comments. It told my story of how her tough stand on immigration affects the legitimate, the law-abiding, and the defenseless rather than dealing with any perceived threat by illegal immigrants, migrant workers, or European nationals.</p>
<p><em>Jaccui Smith should resign because she used a misleading public story to back plans which bring shame and financial hardship to people.</em></p>
<p>One of the most controversial campaigns Ms Smith backed was one to introduce compulsory ID cards to the UK. She <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7712275.stm">claimed that people would willingly sign up to such a scheme</a>, and much talk of fighting terrorism with these bits of plastic ensued. <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Millions-may-resist-database-says-poll.html">This is a lie</a>, really. People don&#8217;t want it—or, at least, the majority of people don&#8217;t seem to want to spend their money on them. Oh, yes. Not only is the scheme <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/And-the-bad-news-ID-cards-cost-2bn-more.html">hugely</a> expensive to the public, but individuals will have to buy them themselves. The card could cost £30, £60 or <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/immigrationpolicy.idcards">£93</a>, depending on which confused source reported the cost [1]. The scheme itself will cost the UK taxpayers around <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/docA_IPS_cost_report%202009_v11_BM.pdf">£5bn with an additional £375mn</a> coming from foreign nationals, who will be the first victims of the programme.</p>
<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/index.asp">The ID cards information</a> produced by the Home Office itself reads, to this linguist at least, shockingly like propaganda. It produces press releases such as <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/press-2009-05-05a.asp">this one</a>, which appear to show an eagerness which belies the fact that nearly every mention I&#8217;ve seen in media regarding the scheme has contained the word &#8220;Controversial&#8221;. It has proven so controversial, indeed, that the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/3127696.stm">latest report</a> I read showed that the Home Office seems to have changed its mind massively. This leads me to believe that the Home Office misleads, both in content and in linguistic implication through its own media.</p>
<p><em>Jacqui Smith should resign because her policy to introduce ID cards is </em><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8037085.stm"><em>not democratically supported</em></a><em>, is questionable and expensive, and her promotion of the scheme is biased and untrue.</em></p>
<p>On any <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/jacqui-smith-key-moments">number</a> of profiles trying to make sense of or <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/jacqui-smith-resignation">summarise</a> Ms. Smith&#8217;s career, another low point has been the proposal to <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7130072.stm">allow imprisonment without charge for 42-days of suspected terrorists</a>. This has proven controversial (simply search for &#8220;Jacqui Smith 42 days&#8221; to see.) and demonstrates Ms Smith&#8217;s disregard for the ancient principle of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Due_process#In_England">due process</a>. The Proposal was mercifully <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7668477.stm">scrapped</a> last year.</p>
<p><em>Jacqui Smith should resign because her principles do not include thousand-year-old fundamentals of basic citizens&#8217; rights.</em></p>
<p>Not everything undertaken by Ms Smith has been terrible. Throughout a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8079374.stm">mixed career</a>, it should be mentioned that she held her ground, proved resiliant, and handled difficulties well (until now). The Right Honourable Jacqui Smith, MP has been the UK&#8217;s first female Home Secretary, and no doubt worked very hard. However, this was expected of an MP, and a Home Secretary should handle her job well, which is why it is news when this has not been the case.</p>
<p>Ms. Smith has been forced out of office following news of the least-damaging scandal. Shame on the media for blowing out of perspective the theft of several thousand pounds in claimed expenses in the light of a proposed spend of £5bn to encumber citizens and ostracize legitimate foreign nationals. Shame on the reporting that claims her husband&#8217;s silly use of £10 to watch porn should take precedent for misleading a nation, trying to create and enforce draconian laws and damaging the reputation of a great democracy.</p>
[1]: It should be noted that the £93 claim is old, and that the Home Office seems to say most recently that the cards will cost £30 for early adopters and rise to £60 after two years.</p>
<p>Additional ID Card Stories include: <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7736588.stm">Scotland refuses to back them.</a>, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/article587163.ece">and some initial concern about the cost raised by the LSE</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:70de8c8b-e723-4faa-8a38-1fe258747336" class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="display: inline; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Blogging about politics can be a bit of a mixed bag, so we&#8217;ll see how it goes. I want to avoid polarising talk, tabloid tactics, and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt). Instead, I&#8217;d like to discuss the latest raft of changes which seek to make immigrants &#8216;more British&#8217; before offering them citizenship.</div>
<h2>Personal Perspective</h2>
<p>First, and as a matter of context: I am an immigrant. I was born and raised in Colorado, USA, and have lived in the UK for the last 5 years or so. My national identity, however, is a more complicated matter. I resonate politically better with Britain than the United States. I admire more British personages than American (probably due to the fact that the only great Americans I can think to name are either dead or long dead&#8230;). I laugh at British comedians, and listen to Radio 4. I queue. I share the occasional withering glance  with my fellow public transport passengers whenever a tourist declares loudly that something is cute or quaint. I even say: &#8220;Oh, excuse me, sorry&#8221; when someone else runs into me at Sainsburys, and I say &#8220;Cheers&#8221; or &#8220;Ta&#8221; even when someone should be thanking me.</p>
<p>This has put me in an interesting position at times. I have been part of conversations when the other party doesn&#8217;t actually know, or momentarily forgets, that I grew up singing <em>The Star-Spangled Banner</em> before watching baseball.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think Americans are rude and ignorant&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re always going on about how small everything is and they don&#8217;t know where Somerset is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know where Somerset is, and I have been asked where Shropshire is by Londoners,&#8221; I reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you&#8217;re different. You&#8217;re not really American. You don&#8217;t have an accent&#8230; and you&#8217;re don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m cute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite&#8221;</p>
<h2>Immigration in the UK</h2>
<p>I get the feeling that many mainstream British ideas are fairly far removed from immigrants as people. There is a distinct <em>themness</em> about immigrants, and I think this notion is exploited by politicians and commentators who have to justify their cynical existences. Over the past five years, I have learned that immigration is ranked among education and health in the national psyche, and politicians who <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">want</span> need to be seen <em>doing something</em> can easily turn to immigration policy for support. This national concern for immigration is baffling.  According to the National Statistics Office, less than 10% of the UK population were foreign born in 2006. (In the US, for the same year the number was nearly 14%). So, less than one in ten people in the UK are foreign born, and even fewer of those have recourse to public funds, yet this ranks among Education and Health?</p>
<p>I can see that there is cause for thought, cause for discussion, but not cause for concern. A study for the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/www.oecd.org" target="_blank">OECD</a> stated: “the ratio of immigrants (no matter how defined) has grown steadily in all Western European countries considered, except Belgium.”<em>1</em> So, immigration is definitely on the rise, and I don&#8217;t debate that. However, most of them have the sense not to move to Belgium so they can&#8217;t be all bad. The flip side of this is that immigration has actually increased the UK economic growth rate, according to the TUC. There is, I feel, cause for concern in that the general public does not understand immigration all that well as outlined by a brilliant article from the sometimes-inflammatory <em>Independent</em>: &#8220;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/lies-damned-lies-and-immigration-412885.html" target="_blank">Lies, Damned Lies and Immigration</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Now, what has really got me angry is the new scheme from Jacqui Smith, Home Secretary, that immigrants will have to work harder to &#8220;earn their right to become UK citizens&#8221;.  (Press Coverage: <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/nmigrant120.xml" target="_blank"><em>Telegraph</em></a>, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/immigrationpolicy.immigration" target="_blank"><em>Guardian</em></a>, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/article3399454.ece" target="_blank"><em>Times</em></a> and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/7254926.stm" target="_blank">BBC</a>) and it includes increasing the time before a migrant can be naturalised and an increased fee. Gordon Brown has also mentioned, according to Radio 4 reports and the Times (see link above) that immigrants should have to undertake community service to be introduced to the British Way of Life.</p>
<p>Let me explore that a bit:</p>
<h4>Money</h4>
<p>It costs a fortune to immigrate to the UK. I am American, and chose to move to the UK for love &#8211;my wife is British. I like it here, but it is an expensive place to live. Tax is high, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/article3407757.ece" target="_blank">services are expensive</a>, and it is required of an Immigrant to pay large sums of money every few years. I should mention that I have been paying UK income tax  and national insurance despite being unable to access public funds for some of my immigration journey and that I attended a UK university after marrying and immigrating, and paid full fees (during the time, around £9k/year) so none of my education was subsidised by any taxes I have paid.</p>
<p>The cost of visas and fees is high, indeed. There is a cost for the initial visiting Visa to get married (currently £500) which lets you stay here for 6 months, without recourse to public funds. You then must apply for temporary residency (£395) which lasts for a couple years. Then, if you want indefinite leave to remain (and if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll need to sort out alternative accommodation fast) it will cost you £750. I&#8217;ve paid each of them, one after the other every few  months or years. The total: £<strong>1645</strong>, and I&#8217;m still not a citizen. If I want to become one, I still have to pay <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/bookstore.asp?trackid=001261&amp;FO=1240167" target="_blank">£9.99 for a book on what it means to be British</a> (Ha!), £<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/www.lifeintheuktest.gov.uk" target="_blank">34 to take a citizenship test</a> (<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/article584918.ece" target="_blank">which most UK citizens can&#8217;t actually pass</a>) <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/cost" target="_blank">and a massive £655 for the application</a>. Then I&#8217;d be invited to attend a citizenship ceremony at which I will be required to pledge an oath, and I haven&#8217;t found out if that costs me more yet&#8230; new total? <strong>£2343.99,</strong> and Jacqui Smith wants more. I see this as a combination of four distinct ideas, blended in a dangerous cocktail:</p>
<ul>
<li>A genuine need for money to run immigration services</li>
<li>A cash-cow for a cash-greedy government</li>
<li>A political scapegoat for opportunistic political figures</li>
<li>A Protection Racket, where people who are legally seeking residence are exploited with the threat of having their life plans crushed</li>
</ul>
<h3>British Way of Life</h3>
<p>What, exactly did Gordon Brown mean when he said he was thinking of having immigrants doing more in the community? I am assuming he did not mean most of the plumbing, or supplementing the taxes for an aging population. For clarity, let me say that these proposed changes will have no effect on the most discussed group of migrants: Eastern Europeans. They already have access to the country through the EU and do not need to pay all the clearance fees. So, making all the non EU migrants do community service will help them to understand what it means to be British? I would have thought a crash-course in happy slapping or under-aged drinking would have been more apt. How many British people do you know who do community service?The most illuminating illustration I heard about the preposterousness of this was a commentator on Radio 4 who pointed out that Abu Hamza (hook-handed, one-eyed favourite of the <em>Sun</em> headlines and controversial fundamentalist cleric of Finsbury Park mosque) could have been said to have been active in his community, and undertook volunteer work. Gordon Brown&#8217;s government has already implemented a Britishness test (see link in previous paragraph) which is so patronising and oblique I don&#8217;t know what it is for. Some of the facts you are expected to know (Taken directly off the test site):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where have migrants come from in the past and why? What sort of work have they done?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do women have equal rights in voting, education and work, and has this always been the case?</strong> <em>(What does this have to do with Britishness? Do we need to know that we were tardy giving women the vote, that there is still a disgraceful gender pay gap or that women are under-represented in all aspects of public society? Surely we don&#8217;t want Migrants thinking about that too much?)</em></li>
<li><strong>When do children take tests at school? How many go on to higher education?</strong> <em>(This changes every couple years, drastically.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Do many children live in single parent families or step-families?</strong> <em>(Any ideas? Have a guess&#8230;</em><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/nugget.asp?id=348" target="_blank"><em>2,672,000</em></a><em> dependent children in single parent families, according to the National Statistics Office. Bet you didn&#8217;t know that.)</em></li>
<li><strong>How many people belong to an ethnic minority and which are the largest minority groups? Where are there large ethnic communities? </strong></li>
<li>And finally, my favourite: <strong>Where are Geordie, Cockney and Scouse dialects spoken?</strong> <em>(I&#8217;d have said North London, where you can hear quite a few more than that, just on one street!)</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Finally, Timing</h3>
<p>Is one extra year without citizenship going to make any difference to society? The people who want to become citizens have already been inundated with extortionate fees, made to feel unwelcome, and made to wait for more than 5 years for a passport and the right to vote. These people are already here, and cannot have broken any residence laws anyway. It will not effect illegal immigrants, assylum seekers, EU Immigrants, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/nondomtax?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront" target="_blank">Non-doms</a> (stupid name that sounds like <em>condom</em> every time a news-reader says it!) or terrorists. They will have been working and paying tax, and are likely to work in jobs not filled by Britain&#8217;s workforce anyway (According to TUC report). One more year without representation or a passport  is an easy way for Jacqui Smith to appear tougher on immigration without changing the numbers at all. It is a meaningless gesture, which only benefits a small number of wealthy politicians seeking to look tough and adds months of difficulty for normal people.</p>
