								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="lightview" href="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/2596595550_50d53740c8_m.jpg"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px;" title="Blog image" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/2596595550_50d53740c8_m.jpg?resize=216%2C162" alt="" width="216" height="162" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Some of my long-term readers (hi, Mum) might remember that my original blog was a Drupal install, and that my less-than-lovely ISP dropped my connection as I was uploading some new filesâ€”therefore borking the CSS. If you don&#8217;t follow, that&#8217;s OK. The point is that my old site was Drupal (a heavy-duty Content Management System, which is fantastic) now it&#8217;s Wordperss (cause it does blogging, and does it well). Well, WordPress has won my geeky heart (it&#8217;s smaller than my cynical heart, and not as strong as my music heart, but probably the most covered here).</p>
<p>They have done one thing in the past month which has really, really impressed me. They&#8217;ve got a plugin which lets you upgrade to the latest version of their software (which you install on your webserver yourself) without any complicated, difficult-to-remember steps. This is why I lost Drupal: upgrading, and it killing itself in the transfer. Now, I have the latest WordPress, and I&#8217;m very impressed.</p>
<p>Its WYSIWYG editor works better, and the media manager is fantastic. As you probably know, I stopped using a local blogging client because ecto is rubbish, and Vista is worse. So I now blog from WordPress itself through Firefox on my Mac. Three things that make me happy: WordPress on Firefox running on a Mac&#8230; ah!</p>
<p>Another thing which is brilliant is the flickr sidebar plugin I have had for ages. I completely forgot to check out its &#8220;<a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/flickr">view more photos</a>&#8221; link. It automatically finds images from the sets I&#8217;ve told it about, and uses them to create a page on my site populated with my flickr stream images!</p>
<p>On a down side, I&#8217;ve just noticed that it&#8217;s impossible to see the bottom of the sidebar if Twitter is down, because I have my tweets (micro-blog messages) being pulled into a widget above it, so if it&#8217;s down, it doesn&#8217;t load the rest of the sidebar. I think that&#8217;s something WordPress should sort out. Oh, well. I&#8217;m just going to switch my images tab over to flickr.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/www.kiva.org"></a>It&#8217;s been a few months since I last spoke about Kiva.org, and I wanted to bring it up again. </p>
<p>Since writing, I&#8217;ve tried out the lending scheme, and am blown away with the ability to make a difference to places where it&#8217;s seriously needed. Not only has Kiva created an infrastructure for microlending which makes it incredibly easy to lend small amounts to entrepreneurs in developing countries, but it makes use of the very nature of the Web in connecting you with people all over the world. </p>
<p>The idea of &#8216;sponsorship&#8217; isn&#8217;t really stressed. This isn&#8217;t a: &#8220;For pennies a day, you could clean this water&#8230;&#8221; It&#8217;s much more of a chance to invest directly into the lives of people who need it, and have a chance to pull themselves up. </p>
<p>My primary worry, when lending (giving) is that I&#8217;ll be made to feel like a vouyer in some way. Instead of concern, I worry that I will be made to focus on fascination or curiosity. This doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case with Kiva. Although it doesn&#8217;t feel like a standard business transaction, it does present enough facts in a straight-forward way. There is not over-blown language, but clear presentation of cases.</p>
<p>I also feel more comfortable lending directly to &#8220;partners&#8221; in developing nations. I feel this is much more efficient, and more in the spirit of a digital age. Why would I want to pay the salary of a well-meaning (and not, in any way exploitative) but still Western individual with my giving, when I can invest directly in people already poised to make a difference?</p>
<p>Finally, and possibly most importantly: Kiva doesn&#8217;t take any cut of the loans they provide. Instead, they ask for a separate donation (without any nag or detriment to the service). They don&#8217;t make a big deal of this (rightly), but I feel I should mention it. These people are providing a world-changing service, with few resources, without charging anything for &#8216;upkeep&#8217;. Not only that, but they only ask after you&#8217;ve chosen an amount and a project to support, making it less likely for you to lower your loan amount at that stage to compensate the infrastructure.</p>
<p>To my mind, this is the future of peer-to-peer investment and development. Now, we just need a way to send other resources in a similar infrastructure (education, information, digital resources, experience, and design).</p>

Image by <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2319114487" target="_blank">. SantiMB . (too busy)</a> via Flickr</div>
<p>I grew up in a Mac family. My dad used to programme <em>accounts recievable</em> applications on an old, black and white Macintosh, and that was my first encounter with any sort of GUI. Since then, I&#8217;ve used both Mac&#8217;s and PC&#8217;s and have a <a class="zem_slink" title="MacBook" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/MacBook">MacBook</a> for work and a poorly-running, but still brand-new Vista box in my home study. I&#8217;ve even dabbled with Linux several times.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m starting to realise something: an aweful lot of applications (on every platform) get aesthetics completely wrong.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a balance between looking nice, feeling comfortable, and aiding use. I think that the appearance of an application is as important a part of the design as the application itself. It&#8217;s a <em>part </em>of the usability, it&#8217;s not &#8216;eye candy&#8217; slapped on for gratuitous reasons.</p>
<p>This is something Mac&#8217;s understand, and their GUI is gorgeous. Vista&#8217;s pretty good-looking itself, but that&#8217;s it&#8217;s problem: that&#8217;s all it is. The operating system is huge, heavy, slow and unpredictible. It crashes, hangs, and takes minutes to load. I bought a brand new (though admittedly budget-conscious PC) from a manufacturer who shall remain nameless (cough! Dell! cough&#8230;) which barely runs just the <a class="zem_slink" title="Operating system" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Operating_system">OS</a>. I&#8217;ve had to triple the RAM and will be re-installing this weekend.</p>
<p>So, what Can I do about it? I can switch <a class="zem_slink" title="Windows Aero" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Windows_Aero">Aero</a> off&#8230; leaving me with a huge, heavy, unpredictable and slightly-less-slow OS which is now ugly. So there&#8217;s Vista, tipping in the balance with an &#8220;eye candy&#8221; approach at aesthetic design.</p>
<p>I see the visual layout, graphics, and overall presence of an application as part of it&#8217;s feature-set. It should be intuitive to interact with it somehow. I fine OS X much more intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing. Some apps written for it, however, fall far short it it&#8217;s high mark.</p>
<p>ecto is a blogging application for OS X, and it&#8217;s plain. It&#8217;s not minimalist-chic. It&#8217;s not &#8220;sleek&#8221;. It&#8217;s boring and plain. It also isn&#8217;t intuitive, unfortunately. It&#8217;s got loads of features, but it misses its greatest asset: the fact that it&#8217;s built on the most advanced <a class="zem_slink" title="Graphical user interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Graphical_user_interface">Graphic User Interface</a> ever developed.</p>
<p>Strangely, <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/windows-live-services-sucklook-nice-delete-as-appropriate/">I much prefer to blog using Windows Live Writer</a>! Its design works well, it&#8217;s interesting-looking (without being LOUD, like the rest of the intrusive Vista package) and it does what it says it will. It interacts very well with images (unlike ecto!), videos and links. It also has the ingenious feature of dowloading your site&#8217;s CSS so you can actually see how the post <em>should</em> look <em>in situ</em>. (Granted, this doesn&#8217;t always work&#8230;)</p>
<p>The point of this slightly oblique and poorly-thought-out rant, is that the point of software is to make peoples lives better. Designers completely miss that. Window&#8217;s OS designers seem to have thought: &#8220;I know, they want pretty. We&#8217;ll give &#8217;em pretty. It&#8217;ll be so pretty, it&#8217;ll need 3GB RAM and a high-end Graphics Card just to run&#8230; that&#8217;ll show &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s rubbish.</p>
<p>However, whoever was heading the design team for the Live suite (Writer, Mail, Messenger <em>et al</em>), was clearly desinging from an end-user&#8217;s perspective. Their thoughts were probably more along the lines of:</p>
<p>&#8220;hmm, when I blog, I like to be able to do that with images. Wouldn&#8217;t it be good if we could see how it&#8217;d look on the site before we publish? Yeah, Hey! I think people will find this useful&#8230; ooh, that looks good, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear how you get on when designing or using software. Being me, I don&#8217;t think it stops with software design, but is actually a feature of how we live and interact. Let me know&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know this is behind the game, and that the bleeding edge of blog reviews has moved well beyond online streaming service Hulu (even though it&#8217;s not yet out to the public). But I received my beta invite last week and have had all this time to play around with it.</p>
<p>My initial thoughts: none.</p>
<p>No, not one initial thought. Hulu doesn&#8217;t work in the UK. They don&#8217;t tell you: &#8220;Hey, if you live in the UK, you will be able to access and begin your Hulu experience, but when you choose a show to stream, you&#8217;ll be disappointed. Have a nice day.&#8221; You have to jump through all the Beta hoops to get there first.</p>
<p>Now, I know I should have known better, being a generally web-savvy chap. But after a few pre-reviews of the Hulu service, I decided not to read any more blogs about it until after I&#8217;d tried it out myself. I knew not to expect too much, after reading the last review over at <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hulu-news-corp-and-the-web-2-0">Between the Lines</a> , but I wanted my own experience.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve found dozens of blogs about how bad it is that Hulu <a>doesn&#8217;t work in Europe</a>. Aside from whingeing about the lack of support, I can&#8217;t really think of anything more to write about Hulu (apart from its ridiculous, trying-too-hard-for-the-Web-2.0-market <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hulu-news-corp-and-the-web-2-0">name</a>).</p>
<p>But, doesn&#8217;t this kind of go against point of the web? The idea that we can make connections, share content, stream and connect?</p>
<p>The principle of the internet is broken by this experiment, and I don&#8217;t think a platform intended to be a YouTube killer should ever have been trialled in a geographically-limited network. Sure, I understand private Betas, but why limit this to the States? I don&#8217;t think News Corp really gets the Web 2.0 thing. In fact, I wonder if they really <i>get </i>the internet?</p>
<p>It reminds me of LaunchCast (now Yahoo Music). When I first launched the player, all the content was free, and there was absolutely loads of it. I was thrilled! Over months, however, content became harder to find due to advertisement interruptions and restrictions on skipping tracks. Suddenly, Launch re-directed to Yahoo, and I could no longer skip any content without upgrading to a premium service which hadn&#8217;t existed before. Then, when I moved to Britain, all the content was unavailable apart from a limited selection which I can only presume was intended for a British audience. (Don&#8217;t think my mates here would have agreed in a focus group!)</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used a yahoo service since. No, seriously, I haven&#8217;t used Yahoo. As soon as Konfabulator was purchased by Yahoo, I uninstalled it. I was all set to set up a Flickr account, when I found out it was Yahoo. (I might go back on that one, once I get a decent digital camera.)</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t really a boycott so much as a pre-emptive decision. I know that as soon as Yahoo gets a hold of a service, its user-friendliness will dissolve into advertisements and &#8216;premium services&#8217; (a contradiction in terms!) This is what Hulu reminds me of. An attempt at grabbing a market instead of a well-thought-out startup trying to sell a genuinely good service and make a profit on its quality.</p>
<p>What is Web 2.0? Hulu doesn&#8217;t know, and it makes me think that News Corp hasn&#8217;t really got its head round it at all. I shudder to think <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/news-corp-looking-to-buy-linkedin">what&#8217;s going to happen with LinkedIn</a>.</p>
