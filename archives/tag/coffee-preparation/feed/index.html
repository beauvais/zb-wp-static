								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Fool&#8217;s Gold</h2>
<p>As a child in Colorado, I have a distant memory of finding a nugget of pure gold, bigger than the tip of my thumb. I instantly became the richest kid in America! I thought I could buy a husky (with a sled) and a Tama Starclassic Birch studio set with a full range of Paiste cymbals, and maybe a house or three. I could move out on my own, I could—so many expectations; so many promises.</p>
<p>My dad took a quick look and said something like: &#8220;Wow, you&#8217;ve found iron pyrite. Fools Gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>The disappointment! All those things to which I was looking forward disappeared, and the lump of cold angles suddenly seemed a reminder of what could have been.</p>
<p>I have recently had a similar experience with some fools coffee.</p>
<h2>Coffee Suppositories?</h2>
<p>I was asked by <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/www.miele.com">Miele</a> to trial a high-end coffee machine for three weeks, and give an honest account of what I found. I was thrilled, since the last time I got to play with a 5-figure espresso machine was during uni working as a barista. I built up a few images in my mind; imagining pulling perfect shots of central-american Cup of Excellence blends, practising my crema, and tasting half a dozen different coffees to see which worked best with the £1,000 set up. My interest was only piqued further when a colleague at work described Miele as &#8220;the Rolls Royce of appliances&#8221;.</p>
<p><a class="lightview" href="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/3410528538_67355752d7_m.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="undrinkable" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/3410528538_67355752d7_m.jpg?resize=180%2C240" alt="" width="180" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>About three weeks ago, a courier arrived as I sat working from my home office. He delivered a box big enough for a springer spaniel to sleep in, and heavy enough to make the manly nonchalance I affected while carrying it away from the door quite difficult indeed. Nonetheless, I left the box packaged and wrapped up in the hall until the evening, looking forward to the reward of an espresso or six after work.</p>
<p>As I worked my way through the layers of packaging, I gradually unveiled a stainless-steel, microwave-like appliance that dwarfed anything else my kitchen held, except—just—the oven. I scanned the quick-start guide and with a single word, my expectations instantly disappeared: &#8220;nespresso&#8221;. I lost the will even to unpack and set up this monstrously-large contraption.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I did set it up, removing all of a counter-top from usable space. My disappointment, if anything, grew as I laboriously set up the menu through an achingly-complicated process involving the use of arrow buttons and &#8220;OK&#8221; to calibrate a dizzying array of possible settings. Throughout the next two hours, I played with settings, opened all the openable compartments and tried several of the coffee suppositories. My thoughts follow:</p>
<p>The Miele CVA3650 is a giant appliance which costs £1,000 (c. $1400). It looks impressive, with a stainless-steel finish and various accoutrements, including backlighting, obviously included as talking features. It would not feel out of place in a posh flat in Kensington—fitting in like an addition to a designed suite of expensive appliances. Indeed, the lasting impression is of a lifestyle rather than coffee. <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/features.aspx?pid=687">Browsing the Miele site</a>, I found many photos of kitchens, appliances, and artfully-arranged mugs sometimes held by comfortable, rich-looking models. The only thing missing from these photos?</p>
<p><a class="lightview" href="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/3468637867_97933db093_m.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="fools gold" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/3468637867_97933db093_m.jpg?resize=180%2C240" alt="" width="180" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Coffee.</p>
<p>Nespresso tastes worse than I thought it actually could. I&#8217;m not saying that to be snobbish about my coffee, and I was genuinely curious to know what the little, coloured &#8220;pods&#8221; could produce. The result of every single &#8220;brew&#8221; was a flat, metallic, suspension of frankly disgusting, tepid liquid. Some aspect of the extraction produces an interestingly-contrived crema every single time, so the drink (I can&#8217;t call it coffee) certainly looks impressive. My wife recoiled after the first sip, and I left more than one completely untouched. The terrible &#8220;flavia&#8221; machine in my office makes better-tasting coffee than this!</p>
<p>The Miele machine is touch-button automation at it&#8217;s most falsely economic (time-wise). Sure, it&#8217;s convenient to press a button and have an espresso (ahem!) within 30 seconds, but that does not account for the half-hour (no joke) of programming every time the machine is re-plugged back in. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m green-conscious enough to flip the switch at the wall after every brew, so this makes it ridiculous to use. The menuing system is cumbersome enough to make my eyes water. Two arrows, and &#8220;OK&#8221; to make every selection. It takes a huge amount of patience, and its&#8230; just&#8230; aweful! So many features, so few necessary or even useful. You can, for example, programme 9 different &#8220;user profiles&#8221;. Why? It&#8217;s a pod of shite coffee, which will taste EXACTLY the same, no matter which button you push. Why go through dozens and dozens of beeps in order to have a user-specific nescafe?</p>
<p>The only part of this machine which is convenient, is the actual making of a drink. For that, it is fast! It produces a <del datetime="2009-04-23T22:23:17+00:00">coffee</del> of your choice (out of 5 different capsules) very rapidly (provided it&#8217;s been programmed and has already been switched on, obviously.) It will then automatically rinse itself, and let you make another soil infusion very rapidly. You only have to remove the spent capsules periodically from a tub within the machine, and fill up a water reservoir whenever it&#8217;s low (though, this is fairly frequently, thanks to the rinsing).</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Before writing this post, I sent Miele&#8217;s representatives a quick heads&#8217; up, with a brief summary which I think works well.</p>
<blockquote><p>I understand its premise of being a super-convenient means of having a sophisticated-looking hot beverage, but I much prefer my coffee to be tasty, regardless of time. And the amount of time spent scrolling endlessly through menus isn&#8217;t really conducive to suiting busy people like myself as a domestic coffee machine. <em>[in reply to the statement that it might prove to be]</em> I&#8217;d be much more likely to advise people invest in a cafetiere, grinder and decent beans. For the £1,000 they could have spent on this, they could have many scores of kilos of excellent, locally-roasted, hand-sourced beans, and enough left over to send a thank-you bottle of single malt to the coffee roaster.</p></blockquote>

<p>The British have a strange relationship with coffee. On one hand, they have an overwhelming love for hot beverages. Only here will you be offered a cuppa during a break from gardening in hot sunshine. You will have a hot drink during family visits, dinner parties, and any time when it is not virtually impossible to hold a mug. All in all, this is fantastic. I happily join the gathering round the kettle when it&#8217;s less than boiling outside. I tend to ask for tea, because British coffee is usually instant.</p>
<p>The other side of British coffee is the British Imported Coffee Culture (BICC). BICC can be found in high-street chain shops. each takes an ever-so-slightly different angle on Seattle/Italian café chic. Most of the coffee from these shops seems to come from the same bean and machine combination. The atmosphere is identical, with a dominant shade of maroon, brown, blue or green making the walls the only distinguishing mark. To the consternation of Brits the country over, each has its own opaque size system, designed to confuse and belittle the customer who inevitably ends up asking: &#8220;But, which is the <em>small</em> one?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as if the BICC cartel, gathered at some point in the early 2000&#8217;s and set down some industry guidelines on preparing British coffee.</p>
<p><strong>First,</strong> because the British palette has been evolved around the flavours of milky tea and biscuits, BICC beverages must avoid shocking customers. Aim to be essentially flavourless. Any foreign smart-arses asking for espresso will be greeted with a small glass of burnt tea leaves suspended in hot dishwater.<br />
<strong>Second</strong>, all baked goods (which are mandatory at a proper British coffee house) shall be supplied from a limited BICC-approved list of bakeries. Pastries shall be huge, greasy muffins and strangely contrived cake combinations like apricot and prune biscotti brownies. The more creative and unlikely combinations will be considered for annual prizes.<br />
<strong>Third</strong>: wherever possible, a smattering of faux-Italiano shall be displayed and worked into the jargon of serving staff (i.e. baristas), to cover any coffee blunders with embarrassing cultural ambiguity.<br />
<strong>Finally,</strong> because this is all imported and frightfully expensive-sounding, we shall be setting the prices for beverages, baked goods, and sandwiches at just below the cost of the weekly shopping. The business logic for this last point, as you can see from the infographic, is that aspiring people will gladly pay extortionate cultural tariffs to appear coffee-literate.</p>
<p>Thus it was that the executive classes of Britain were won over to incredibly expensive milk, with the small addition of highly-addictive coffee made with impressive-looking but fully-automatic espresso machine monsters.</p>
<p>Not happy with their strangle-hold on Britain&#8217;s purchasers of pin-stripes, however, British Coffee Culture soon began infiltrating more reputable establishments. I know that the transformation of Imported Coffee Culture is more or less complete, now. I was recently offered a &#8220;mochacino-latte&#8221; at a seaside chip shop. (After seeing the BICC-branded instant beverage machine behind the counter littered with polystyrene cups and a suspicious powder, I declined). These shops and places of amusement have opted for a lighter touch, however, and have begun simply calling it &#8220;froffee coffee&#8221;. The froffee coffee is a uniquely British coffee-like drink made mainly from powdered milk sprayed through a plastic nozzle into a brown concentrate. The resulting chemical reactions produce a strangely petroleum-flavoured foam atop an instant-coffee. If you&#8217;d like to make it a &#8220;somethingcino&#8221;, you simply add a few tablespoons of powdered drinking chocolate to the foam, cup, napkin and surrounding customers.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, most Brits are still impressed by a cafetière, or anything which can be labelled &#8220;proper coffee&#8221;. Proper coffee, like the froffee coffee, is a British sobriquet for any coffee not made by adding boiling water to brown granules. I suspect that in some households, the granules placed in a coffee pot rather than directly into a mug qualify as proper.</p>
<h2>Making proper, British coffee</h2>
<p>I have decided, as a public service, to challenge the BICC, the Froffee Coffee and the proper coffee by outlining a few simple ways to experience bliss.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beans</li>
<li>Grinder</li>
<li>Cafetière/coffee press</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s dead simple, really. Buy some beans, and don&#8217;t cry when you pay for them. A bag of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/www.unionroasted.com">British</a>&#8211;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/www.hasbean.co.uk">roasted </a>beans will set you back about the same as a single, higher-priced drink at your local BICC establishment.</p>
<p>Buy a coffee grinder. I&#8217;ve encountered the myth that grinders are incredibly expensive. I think the only power behind this is that no one seems to own one, making them seem rare and exclusive: <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=kitchen&amp;amp;qid=1223235555&amp;amp;sr=8-1">here&#8217;s one for just over a tenner</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, a cafetière, or coffee-press. As my family in the US calls them: French Press – possibly now the &#8220;Freedom Press, but I can&#8217;t be sure because I don&#8217;t watch Fox News.</p>
<p>Grind the fresh beans (don&#8217;t keep them longer than a fortnight) until they&#8217;re coarsely ground. The grounds should look like sand, not flour. Boil the kettle, and pour a bit into the cafetière to warm it up. Pour this out and add the grounds. You&#8217;ll want 4-6 good-sized tablespoonfuls of grounds for a four-cup press. Add the off-boil water and stir it so all the beans are nicely wet. Put the lid on, and wait 4 minutes. Plunge and serve.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it. Proper coffee that tastes wonderful.</p>
