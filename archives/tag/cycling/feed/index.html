<p>It is cold.</p>
<p>I have just decided to carry on, trying to ignore the tightness in my chest, and the retching tickle at the back of my throat that says one thing: &#8220;Cough!&#8221;</p>
<p>My ears are already tingling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the Hellequin,&#8221; I pick up the dialogue from a new audiobook. It had faded as I climbed the first hill on my cycle route, which gets steeper toward the top in reality and imagination; and I began to question whether I can make it. I have been trying to count the number of times I had climbed this hill, and I picture the road at the top to prove that I had indeed been up here on two wheels before.</p>
<p>My nose is already running.</p>
<p>Today, the hill is steeper in imagination, and my breath is shorter than normal. It&#8217;s the first day in a week I have been well enough to do any exercise, thanks to a seasonal cold.</p>
<p><em>HEY!</em></p>
<p>A loud noise: a car&#8217;s horn</p>
<p><em>FAT!&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>cough</em></p>
<p><strong>STRAIGHT!</strong></p>
<p><em>cough</em></p>
<p><strong>SHIT!</strong></p>
<p><em>cough</em></p>
<p>A light colour flies past my right hand—the bonnet of a car within a foot of my front wheel.</p>
<p><strong>STRAIGHT</strong></p>
<p><em>cough</em></p>
<p>A laughing face and a waving fist.</p>
<p>&#8230; straight.</p>
<p><em>cough</em></p>
<p>I hear the horn again, and realise it&#8217;s a Ford Ka: full of lads&#8217; faces and Adidas jackets. Then I&#8217;m in paroxysms as I kind of start to work out that it&#8217;s bloody amazing I haven&#8217;t fallen off. I stop pedalling, ditch the bike and cough until I retch for a bit.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t decide whether I&#8217;d shouted the word <em>straight</em> aloud, or if it was just the only thought in my head. I&#8217;m pretty sure I cried: &#8220;Shit!&#8221;</p>
<p>So, here I am: snot and shakes at the side of the road, and I&#8217;m wondering if I should walk my bike back, or just leave the bastard there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>The bike&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not coughing, but I&#8217;m angry. I&#8217;m furious. Now I do shout, unquestioningly, a word I can&#8217;t type.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea what you just did, you Ka-ful of little shits?</p>
<p>Have you got any thought in the direction of just how dangerous this was, or what it means to me as I am right now?</p>
<p>Sure, I&#8217;ve got a cold, and I&#8217;m coughing like a man drowning in porridge. Sure, I&#8217;m on the side of the road dripping snot and cold sweat, and I&#8217;m angry that the only word I could discern from your barrage was: <em>fat</em>.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>They couldn&#8217;t know. They couldn&#8217;t guess, and I doubt they thought much before pulling that incomprehensibly dangerous stunt.</p>
<p>They couldn&#8217;t have known that cycling is desperately important to me, mainly because of that spat-out word: <em>fat</em>. They couldn&#8217;t know the feeling I get from sputtering to the top of that first of several hills, how freeing it is for me. They couldn&#8217;t have a bastard clue that I can <em>only</em> cycle thanks to the 4 discs destroyed in my spine. I cannot walk like I want to, I cannot play sport, I cannot jog or easily lift weights.</p>
<p>They couldn&#8217;t know I&#8217;m terrified of cycling.</p>
<p>They couldn&#8217;t know that last year, cycling <a href="/archives/injury-lessons/">took 2 days out of my memory forever</a>. They can&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m scared whenever I get on the bloody bike. Yet, I love the feeling of doing something physical, and get to feel somewhat normal—even powerful as I pedal my gigantic carcass up steep, Dale hills.</p>
<p>Cycling took six weeks out of the most important and inspiring work I&#8217;ve been able to do, and kept me from supporting my colleagues at a time when every hour counted; and I regret that now that our startup has fallen-over and my friends are no longer colleagues. Cycling gave me a stammer, when my job is to communicate, and I can&#8217;t help but love getting back up on 2 wheels when the only way to balance is to go faster.</p>
<p>That stupid moment will be forgotten already. A quick laugh, maybe a hint of regret in one of their memories. Maybe not.</p>
<p>No, they can&#8217;t know my context, and I can&#8217;t stay as angry as I am.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t know, and that somehow helps.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t know someone&#8217;s back story when you do something to them, and they couldn&#8217;t possibly know that balancing on two wheels is one of the most important things in my life right now.</p>
<p>No, I have to finish the route.</p>
<p>So I do, and I feel free again.</p>
<p>If anything, I feel freer of phlegm.</p>
