								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you know, I&#8217;ve been emailing my ISP recently to find out why my connection drops every evening to around 500k. Following every email I&#8217;ve sent since January, I have received this automatic response (ISP name removed, for now&#8230;):</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for emailing us.</p>
<p>Our Broadband team have received your email and will get back to you in the next 48 hours. We&#8217;re sorry to say that we&#8217;ve received more emails than normal over the past few days and this is why it might take us a bit longer to reply to your email.</p>
<p>Our call centres are also very busy just now so please don&#8217;t call us for an update on our email reply. Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Thanks for waiting.</p>
<p>In the mean time, why not check out our broadband help pages&#8230;(link)</p></blockquote>
<p>A few notes on why this is unsatisfactory:</p>
<p>Firstly, an automatic apology (&#8220;we&#8217;re sorry to say&#8221;) means nothing; and I would advise any customer services to not include one. It is cut from the same cloth as the oddly cheery recorded announcements broadcast at rail platforms: &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry to announce that the **** service to Manchester has been delayed by 45 minutes. We are <strong>extremely</strong> sorry for this delay.&#8221; It raises the blood pressure with its disingenuousness.</p>
<p>Secondly, to say you&#8217;ve received many extra emails is foolish in the extreme. It puts me in the role of one in a mass of unhappy customers who must all be receiving the same service; and I feel more than ever like shopping elsewhere. Additionally, an automatic response saying &#8220;over the past few days&#8221; for two months is hardly accurate. In fact, it&#8217;s a lie. If it&#8217;s been higher than &#8220;normal&#8221; for that long, it&#8217;s a new normal. Gradually, the meaning becomes something like: &#8220;We receive many, many emails of this nature each dayâ€”far more than we&#8217;re prepared for; and we&#8217;re don&#8217;t see this as a problem. We are happy with the level of service we supply enough not to expand our team. Join the club, and we&#8217;ll get back to you, eventually.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thirdly, the opening paragraph is contradictory. One cannot promise 48-hour turnaround in one sentence, then follow it with a sentence explaining it might take a bit longer. It illicits the thought pattern: &#8220;Longer than what? Longer than 48 hours; then you shouldn&#8217;t say it. Longer than expected; then I will expect less than 48 hours and be disappointed if it is around two days.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>Moreover, this email abruptly cuts off communication channels with the users: &#8220;Our call centres are also very busy just now so please don&#8217;t call us&#8221;. This is a slap in the face, especially for someone experiencing connectivity issues. I cannot stress enough how important it is to be open with customers, even for a large service provider. Perhaps, actually, <em>especially</em> for a large service provider. Telling customers in need of support not to phone is extremely unadvised.</p>
<p>I will not go into the grammar (team is singular, I therefore expect &#8220;Broadband team&#8221; to be predicated by the singular stative verb: has; and why is Broadband capitalised?), for this way lies pedantry (and I don&#8217;t want anyone even more pedantic pointing out all <em>my</em> mistakes!)</p>
<p>This is the first communication your customer receives after a complaint, it should be crafted with care. It&#8217;s not <em>just</em> an automatic reply; it&#8217;s the immediate face of your company. And, as it stands now, it&#8217;s not an attractive face at all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be more than happy to outline suggestions for such an email, and I welcome comments.</p>
