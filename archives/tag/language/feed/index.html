								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have subscribed to Tim Ferriss&#8217; blog for a few weeks, and have found its content enlightening and interesting. Having done a degree in applied linguistics, I found the his item about <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/how-to-learn-but-not-master-any-language-in-1-hour-plus-a-favor">learning a language in an hour</a> interesting, if slightly mis-named.</p>
<p>Tim reckons that you can work out how to learn a language in about an hour, but not actually become fluent in it in that time. He lays out a plan for analysing and comparing differences between languages we might already know with a target language, and using that information to make decisions about how to learn.</p>
<p>As part of my studies at Kings, we looked at learning styles and communicative competencies. (Check out <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1">George Yule</a> for more on linguistics). I would have thought that the idea that you can focus on a particular tactic for learning a language lies partly with the language itself (and for that, Tim&#8217;s blog entry seems completely apt), but also on identifying one&#8217;s own learning styles and techniques. Then, a language could be tackled in a way which makes use of one&#8217;s particular strengths while focusing on the areas which would most help.</p>
<p>I recommend Tim&#8217;s blog, and think it&#8217;s well worth a few hours reading!</p>
