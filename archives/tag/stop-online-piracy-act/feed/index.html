								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mediatemple.net">Media Temple</a> (mt) have looked after this site&#8217;s hosting superbly. They handled problems (all of which were down to user error) promptly and with a bit of extra care. Under almost all circumstances, I support companies who work hard for their customers&#8217; loyalty. But, they were bought by <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/uk.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>.</p>
<p>GoDaddy has an impressive reputation for chauvinism, playing on stereotypes, and generally mocking people.</p>
<p>No, seriously:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1090' height='614' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/sS9-CDcDNZ8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>and&#8230;</p>
<p>(video has since been deleted, but you can search YouTube for GoDaddy commercials to get the gist.)</p>
<p>I think you get the picture. In fact, sorry for the pictures. I feel dirty having them on my site, and I feel worse thinking that my hosting money would be supporting such a company.</p>
<p>More troublingly, GoDaddy played a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA">big role in supporting SOPA</a>. Yes, they backed down, and stopped their support&#8230; eventually. But that&#8217;s a big mark against any company.</p>
<p>(mt) were quick to point out, on Twitter, that they&#8217;ve taken the acquisition seriously – that GoDaddy has reinvented itself. Maybe they have; maybe they will. But they&#8217;re the same company, and they make me feel sick.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/beauvais">@beauvais</a> Not necessarily Zach, take a look at our FAQ &#8211; <a href="http://t.co/c8OAuXEvUu">http://t.co/c8OAuXEvUu</a> *MP</p>
<p>&mdash; (mt) Help (@mediatemplehelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/mediatemplehelp/status/390201456336576512">October 15, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Their <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/faqs-about-the-godaddy-acquisition">FAQs</a> point out the reasons they went along, and say they&#8217;ll stay an independent, autonomous company. I wish them the best, but no. Between casual chauvinism, mocking &#8220;nerds&#8221;, and generally seeking profit above freedom – it was an easy decision to make.</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn&#8217;t feel there was a decision to make except on finding a new host.</p>
<p>For now, I&#8217;ve moved my online property over to UK-based <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/www.tsohost.com">TSOHost</a>, on the recommendation of quite a few twitter friends. They migrated my site and domain on the same day, and seem pretty clued up on support so far. I have a few remaining domain names with (mt), one of which – mentaldemocracy.com – I might sell. The rest, I&#8217;ll either transfer over next week, or simply wind them up.</p>
