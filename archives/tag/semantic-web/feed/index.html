								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>
  Every aspect of society and economy that has been touched by the Web has been changed radically. Even the way we interact socially is very different to 15 years ago. &#8230; These changes are being brought about by the Web’s ability to link documents together into a single information space. The Semantic Web extends this to link anything and as such the potential for radical change in our society is vast.
</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">–<em>Ian Davis—Nodalities 2nd Ed</em></p>
<p>Every week, I used to receive a few emails along these lines:</p>
<p><strong><em>Subject: Nodalities, I hope this is OK?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Hi Zach, I&#8217;ve attached my story for Nodalities, and would like to know what you think?</em></p>
<p><em>Best Regards,</em></p>
<p><em>Someone Awesome</em></p>
<p>For three years, I had the chance to read the stories of many of the Semantic Web&#8217;s most exciting developers before anyone else. I was allowed to tell them that I really enjoyed their story—and ask if we could cut it down from 5,000 words to a bit more like 1,000; you know, if you don&#8217;t mind?</p>
<p>Then, I would pull together a generous handful of these stories every couple months and ask our designers to put them between the thick, matte paper covers of what everyone in the office called Nodmag.</p>
<p>The magazine&#8217;s aim was to be the Semantic Web&#8217;s first regular industry publication. We were building a platform for sharing Linked Data and wanted to share news from across the whole industry. I had somehow ended up appearing in Nodalities&#8217; second edition as a co-author with <a title="Ian Davis" href="http://twitter.com/iand">Ian Davis,</a> discussing the Semantic Web as a blue-ocean opportunity.</p>
<p>Before the third issue, my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulMiller">Paul Miller</a> handed me the reigns, and I learned a hell of a lot in those first few months. I enjoyed asking people if they&#8217;d ever considered writing up their project in an article-like piece of prose. This in itself taught me much about collaborative projects, to see how many people were willing to put in extra time to write about their passion and share their skill. It also introduced me to some of the most articulate technologists, who often crystallised abstract and often staggeringly complicated ideas into a form anyone interested in the Web could appreciate.</p>
<p>Editing itself is something I found profoundly enjoyable, and I miss the chance to see the first version of an article, and to work through fixing punctuation and nudging syntax without altering the meaning – adding my own semantic layer to the semantic web. The most rewarding element was working with semantic web people who didn&#8217;t realize they <em>could</em> tell their story. With just a few nudges and hints, their enthusiasm won, and overpowered some restraints of self-conscious writing.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9084" data-permalink="https://beggingaquestion.com/archives/nodmag/editors-notes/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/editors-notes_zlkpci.png?fit=484%2C598&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="484,598" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="editors-notes" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/editors-notes_zlkpci.png?fit=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/editors-notes_zlkpci.png?fit=484%2C598&amp;ssl=1" class="alignleft wp-image-9084" title="editors-notes" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/editors-notes_zlkpci.png?w=1090" alt="semantic web editors notes" data-recalc-dims="1" />I absorbed a lot of information about linking data and applying web technologies, and watched the story unfold from a slightly removed position. Our first articles, for example, tended to look forward—expecting proof-of-concepts and apps in-the-wild.</p>
<p>Over time, the stories began to sound different in tone as they slowly shifted from expectation to sharing progress and discussing work underway. We also saw meticulous research from universities and science institutes. Although being a scholarly journal was beyond the general remit, many academics shared their findings with Nodalities&#8217; audience, kindly writing at a level even I could understand.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2011—amid some <a title="Talis sells library" href="http://www.information-age.com/talis-sells-off-library-software-business-to-focus-on-semantic-web-1607743/">big changes at Talis</a>—I took up the place as community manager in the data marketplace, Kasabi. As a startup, Kasabi really demanded full attention, and I could no longer commit to running the magazine. Also, despite doing the publishing several years, we had never pretended to be a proper publisher, and I had sincerely hoped Nodalities would be superseded by journalists whose coverage of our emerging industry should fare better than one blogging/community chap at a software company could do. So, I put together the last editor&#8217;s notes to appear next to a truly terrible portrait for the final issue in late spring, 2011.</p>
<p>I met incredibly interesting people, and editing is something I very much hope to have the chance to do again someday. I feel honoured to have been first to read these stories, and hope any influence I may have had didn&#8217;t get in the way of the developers&#8217; voices.</p>
<p>Last week, following Talis&#8217; major shift of direction, I felt nostalgic, and wanted to pour over some of the older copies of Nodmag. Alas, I found them missing. I&#8217;ve since heard that there are some plans to archive the site, and to have a home for the magazine somewhere, but in the meantime the back issues of Nodalities are available on github: <a title="Nodalites on Github" href="http://github.com/beauvais/nodalities">github.com/beauvais/nodalities</a>.</p>
<h3 id="edit-final-editors-notes">EDIT: Final Editor&#8217;s Notes</h3>
<hr />
<p>Nodalities has, for three years, told stories from around the ever-expanding sphere of Linked Data. As Editor, I have had the privilege of helping to tell those stories, to meet so many interesting people, and take part in the growth of the Linked Data community.</p>
<p>This will be Nodalities’ final edition.</p>
<p>At Talis, we have never been a media or publishing company&#8211;we build data platforms and applications&#8211;but Nodalities was created to help our community grow and give a voice to those joining and building with us. The magazine has fulfilled it’s purpose, and I am very happy for other media now to take responsibility for telling its stories.</p>
<p>As a final issue, I do not want to look back for context, but forward to new and emerging developments on the Web of Data. So, I have the added privilege of presenting a collection of stories with an emphasis on starting up for the final time.</p>
<p>If you would like to get in touch about any of these stories, or would like to catch up with me about what Talis is working on next, please feel free to contact me on zb@talis.com</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Zach Beauvais</p>

Because Facebook has recently made announcements about moving in a Semantic Web direction, I spoke with their Senior Open Programs Manager, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/davidrecordon.com">David Recordon</a>, about Facebook&#8217;s perspectives on many of the technologies they&#8217;re beginning to use. We ended up discussing Social Networking as a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Graph_(mathematics)">graph</a>—that is: a network of related things. We also spoke about the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/opengraphprotocol.org">Open Graph Protocol</a> they&#8217;ve worked on and touched on privacy and walled gardens.</p>
<p>As you listen to the podcast, you can have a look at the source code for <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com">my site</a>. (Just don&#8217;t run any validators on it and complain about what a poor developer I am: I already know <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). In the head, you&#8217;ll notice a few lines of metadata that are discussed in the podcast:</p>
<div class="su-note" style="border-color:#e5e0b1;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-clearfix" style="background-color:#fef9c5;border-color:#fffef3;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">&lt;meta property=&#8221;og:title&#8221; content=&#8221;Blogging Perspective&#8221; /&gt; &lt;meta property=&#8221;og:type&#8221; content=&#8221;blog&#8221; /&gt; &lt;meta property=&#8221;og:email&#8221; content=&#8221;contact@zachbeauvais.com&#8221; /&gt; &lt;meta property=&#8221;og:url&#8221; content=&#8221;http://www.zachbeauvais.com&#8221; /&gt; &lt;meta property=&#8221;og:description&#8221; content=&#8221;Zach Beauvais&#8217; home on the web: his perspective, images and ideas.&#8221; /&gt;</div></div>
<p>For more information, you can also read the Nodalities Magazine article I wrote about Facebook&#8217;s announcements.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/opengraphprotocol.org">Open Graph Protocol page</a> has information about the protocol itself. <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/f8">Facebook&#8217;s f8 developers&#8217;</a> conference site also has links with more information for developers.</p>
<p>Many thanks to David Recordon for having this conversation with me for Nodalities, and to my employer Talis, who has made this podcast available under a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/3">Creative Commons Attribution 3</a> license. <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/3"><img class="alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/88x31.png?w=1090" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p><a href=""><img class="alignleft" SRC="https://i2.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4050/4655579218_8fcde791d1_m.jpg?w=1090" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This is my first year attending the ESWC (formerly &#8220;European Semantic Web Conference&#8221; now the &#8220;Extended Semantic Web Conference,&#8221; cleverly, the acronym still works) near Heraklion on Crete. It&#8217;s only a couple days in, but I thought it&#8217;d be a good time to report back to the Nodalities readers. ESWC is a gathering of some of the world&#8217;s most influential Semantic Web thinkers, and for me It&#8217;s been a few days of meeting people in the flesh with whom I&#8217;ve been in touch online for years. As one bloke put it: &#8220;What&#8217;s kept you away?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m extremely glad I&#8217;ve not been kept away this year, and have been excited to see what&#8217;s been built recently. ESWC is a very academic conference; indeed I&#8217;m quietly auditing the PhD Symposium as I type this. There are papers, PhD symposia, demos and expositions on topics covering anything from ontology development to MapReduce processing of RDF triples. It seems a very fertile seedbed, with many of these ideas having the potential of growing into projects, startups, papers and possibly industries. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a subtle and largely subconscious transition by blogging mostly about projects that are up and running. This has been important because the Semantic Web world is no longer one of &#8220;someday,&#8221; but a world of current and continuous activity. So, I&#8217;ve talked about visualisations of data, products running on Linked Data, data.gov.uk et.al.; and I&#8217;ve held back on discussing purely possible. It&#8217;s been exciting and uplifting to see the conceptual evolve to the proven and working. But this is a reflection of progress—of moving from hypothesis to implementation. It doesn&#8217;t mean the concepts have stopped flowing. It&#8217;d be a very short story in the history of human communication if the Semantic Web has used up all of its possibilities in ten years! </p>
<p>ESWC is a little microcosm of the wider research going on in Linked Data and related fields. It seems to me that Big Ideas need the traditional frameworks of academic investigation. Questions need to be asked and answered and debated and tried and broken and rebuilt. Much of this science will not become technology, and this is wholly acceptable because it gives the Big Ideas a lot of scope to be refined. </p>
<p>ESWC is just such a place. PhD students and researchers fill the schedule with proposals and reports, and many possibilities are being constantly debated around coffee, beer, and the beach. It&#8217;s been a thoroughly fascinating few days, and I&#8217;m very much looking forward to more over the next few.</p>
<p>As a quick note, Talis sponsored the Scripting for the Semantic Web challenge for this, its final year. Alexandre Passant and Pablo Mendes won the prize with SPARQLpush.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post was originally published on Nodalities Blog.</em></p>
<p>The Talis offices, for the past few weeks, have been awash with geeky excitement—that kind of near giddy excitement that comes with eager expectation. We&#8217;ve all been waiting for something important.</p>
<p>For some, this was no doubt augmented with the announcement of Steve&#8217;s new <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/apple-ipad-future">iPad</a>; but that&#8217;s not what&#8217;s gotten us all worked up.</p>
<p>For months, we&#8217;ve been looking forward to the launch of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a>; and last week, the wraps finally came off. The official press release put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>A major new website has been launched to the public which gives anyone who wants to use it unprecedented and free access to government data in one place.</p></blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t quite capture the coolness of the launch, for me. Yes, it&#8217;s a major new website, and it&#8217;s point is to publish information. But, the exciting thing is that this information is being published as data: data that can be used, reused, remixed and enriched. Sir Tim Berners-Lee&#8217;s perspective was more exciting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Making public data available for re-use is about increasing accountability and transparency and letting people create new, innovative ways of using it. Government data should be a public resource. By releasing it, we can unlock new ideas for delivering public services, help communities and society work better, and let talented entrepreneurs and engineers create new businesses and services.</p></blockquote>
<p>The point is that this public resource is finally getting a home on the web, and an infrastructure to make it not just available, but useful.</p>
<p>The exceptional team behind data.gov.uk have striven to adhere to web standards in its production: including Linked Data as a priority, as Professor Nigel Shadbolt explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are also going to increase the use of ‘Linked Data’ standards, which allows people to provide data in a way that is as flexible and easy-to-use as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in November, Leigh Dodds wrote a post explaining how we&#8217;ve been involved, and there&#8217;s an official Talis Platform <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/news">press release</a> too. Basically, we&#8217;ve been working with the data.gov.uk team to help with the Linked Data part of the site—hosting the SPARQL endpoints and providing consultancy and training, for example.</p>
<p>I can confidently say that we&#8217;re very proud of data.gov.uk, the team behind it, and our involvement with it. We&#8217;re excited by the prospect of this data being used as raw material for clever people to make interesting, useful, even world-changing things with it. We&#8217;ve seen the beginnings and proof-of-concept projects already.</p>
<p>Now comes the really exciting stuff. What are you going to build?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>|This article first appeared in Nodalities Magazine, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2">CC By + SA</a></strong></p>
<p>For anyone following the Nodalities blog, you may have read some of my recent posts discussing the trends boiling up around Web 3.0 (other buzzwords are available). The Mobile Web and upgraded connectivity in general; the rise of ubiquitous computing from chips in every product imaginable; Linked Data and the “Semantic Web” as an organising platform for this rising tide of data—these are three very broad trends seeing a lot of media attention presently. From where I’m standing, I tend to see the next great turning point of the Web as a convergence of some of these trends, and see it as a rise in the importance of and reliance upon data itself and data tools generally.</p>
<p>The mobile web is bringing new sorts of information to people, and they can make use of this info wherever they happen to be because of advances in devices ad connectivity. As phones and web-enabled devices get better, so to do the chips we seem to have embedded all over the place, and we can now begin to have a more clear picture of what we do through the information we gather from our heaters, cars, and pedometers. Also, as more objects become connected, the grunt-work of number-crunching and storage is becoming commoditised into big, efficient, utility-like cloud services, which host and work with our collected information much more effectively than the gadget in your hand could ever hope to do. Others, like us here at Talis, talk about the Semantic Web, which allows for an evolution from a bunch of connected documents to the explicit connections between bits of information.</p>
<p>Also fermenting in this mix is a strengthening trend of political transparency and a public, shared ownership of social data. Barack Obama’s new administration has clearly made this a priority with the launch and work around data.gov; and in the UK, Sir Tim Berners-Lee himself has been appointed to an Parliamentary advisory role. There is growing pressure to be able to have access to public data, and to see it as belonging to the nation’s people rather than allowed to be legitimately filed away in the great, locked bureau of the capitols.</p>
<p>So, picking up two fairly obvious trends here: Social, Public Data and Linked Data; it would seem to follow that people would begin to have access to previously unavailable information in usable, linked forms. And it’s certainly beginning, as articles elsewhere in this magazine have illustrated. But, what about other chunks of public data? What about when data comes from universities, institutions, scientific foundations and NGO’s? What about charities monitoring crime, CO2 emissions and family histories? Wouldn’t these make a useful piece in the web of social data? What resources have the governments themselves got, if they want to make their public-owned data available in a useful format?</p>
<p>These questions form a major part of the thinking behind Talis’ Connected Commons initiative (talis.com/cc). Basically, Talis has made its Semantic Web platform (including data hosting and access tools) available free of charge for any datasets made available to the public. In doing so, we’re hoping to remove the barrier of cost entirely to publishing interesting data in a Linked Data way. One major reason for this is to promote reuse and mashups of this interesting data, and for people to be able to “follow their noses” to the data that completes their projects. But, from a publishers’ perspective, this is important, because it’s removing a major reason not to bother with making data useful, if not only public. So, with this, data can be made public and useable and the developers and users get the benefit of public SPARQL endpoints and API access to interesting data.</p>
<p>To keep the data open and public, datasets need to make use of either the Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) or Creative Commons’ CC0 license. Ian Davis, in his article in this magazine, explains more about waivers and the Connected Commons, and there is a lot more about this particular initiative over on the Talis site (talis.com/platform/cc/faqs/).</p>
<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Sir Tim said: “This is our data. This is our taxpayers’ money which has created this data, so I would like to be able to see it, please.” I wonder if initiatives such as Connected Commons will begin to remove excuses, hindrances, and obstacles? As public awareness of the importance of access gets hotter, this might become a political issue, as well as a pragmatic one. I hope that in the rush to publish data, and in the ensuing discussion and debate that follows, that the users, hackers and developers don’t get sidelined. I think the world is ready for its data back.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>|This first appeared as a <a href="http://readwrite.com/2009/08/04/journalism_needs_data_in_21st_century/">guest post on ReadWriteWeb</a>, republished with kind permission</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beauvais/3791106495/sizes/o/"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 10px;" title="Not News" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2515/3791106495_d9c4cd9d08_m.jpg?resize=193%2C240" alt="" width="193" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Journalism has always been about reporting facts and assertions and making sense of world affairs. No news there. But as we move further into the 21st century, we will have to increasingly rely on &#8220;data&#8221; to feed our stories, to the point that &#8220;data-driven reporting&#8221; becomes second nature to journalists.</p>
<p>The shift from facts to data is subtle and makes perfect sense. You could that say data <em>are</em> facts, with the difference that they can be computed, analysed, and made use of in a more abstract way, especially by a computer.</p>
<p>With this mindset, finding mainstream data-driven stories doesn&#8217;t take long at all. A quick scan of the Guardian&#8217;s home page tells us that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jul/16/swine-flu-cases-rise-britain">swine flu cases are up by 50%</a>, according to &#8220;fresh figures&#8230;[that] will be released this afternoon.&#8221; The story here is that we&#8217;re in danger because swine flu is on the rise. Reporting the current figures available for swine flu alone wouldn&#8217;t be all that interesting. The news comes from comparing the current figures to last week&#8217;s, which is a very simple form of data analysis. By making use of published data and running one&#8217;s own analysis (and building on the analysis of others), we get something very news-worthy indeed. It moves the definition ever so slightly, from &#8220;saying and asserting&#8221; to &#8220;analyzing and publishing.&#8221; But it obviously works only for data that is accessible.</p>
<p>There is nothing new about pointing out the importance of public data being made available. <a class="zem_slink" title="Tim Berners-Lee" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> has discussed at length the importance of governments and institutions putting their data online, making it accessible and useful. His <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/484">TED talk</a> and interviews with <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/interview_with_tim_berners-lee_part_1.php">ReadWriteWeb</a> and Talis (disclosure: I am a blogger at Talis) all explain his belief that by publishing <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/linked_data_is_blooming_why_you_should_care.php">linked data</a> we can begin to solve many of the problems the world faces. Innovations in medicine, science, and development could all be achieved if only currently hidden data were made available. Data-driven journalism could be the first step in realizing this dream. The best stories would then come from innovators who read about trends reported in news media and are then able to draw new conclusions and solve bigger problems. In his recent discussion with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/06/sir_tims_cry_raw_data_now.html">BBC</a>, Berners-Lee said that the next step is to go for low-hanging fruit by just getting the data out there.</p>
<p>Thus far, this has made a lot of sense to me, and I have been tracking the publication of linked data and increasing access to public knowledge as emerging trends over at Talis. But my perspective has shifted a bit in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>First, there was <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a> and President Obama&#8217;s call for more access to government data. A sitting head of state (and one of some significance) was clearly calling for public access to government data: this was news! But the idea has been discussed, praised, and debated for a while since then and may have <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/datagov_finally_launches_looks_nice_but_short_on_d.php">lost some of its luster</a>.</p>
<p>Then about a month ago, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown made it part of his digital strategy to prioritize the publication of government information. He asked Sir Tim personally &#8220;to help us drive the opening up of access to Government data in the web over the coming months&#8221; and appointed Berners-Lee an official governmental adviser. By now, neither of these stories is news and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/open_goverment_berners-lee_and_the_uk_to_show_obam.php">comparisons between the initiatives</a> have been made.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="The Guardian" rel="homepage" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian</a> newspaper recently launched its own <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/mar/10/blogpost1">Data Blog</a>, with the intention of letting readers access, mash up, and reuse much of its information in the form of data, which could in turn drive stories.</p>
<p>What is perhaps not as explicitly recognized is the voracious appetite for data that has been apparent for months. It is less about turning good ideas into stories and more about seeing how data informs our understanding of events happening right now. Each new initiative is another piece of low-hanging fruit picked.</p>
<p>Access to data is important: it drives innovation and even social change. Governments that publish their data <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/what_can_you_do_with_government_data.php">have to become more transparent</a>. Humanitarian organizations that make their findings known could spark bigger projects and source innovative solutions from their communities. Scientific findings and raw information could be used to solve bigger problems than the result of a single experiment or trial could ever manage. Even the simple comparison of two or more facts can lead to new insight, and all of these things happen only when the walls around an institution become porous.</p>
<p>2009 could become known as the year of data, the year of open access, or the year of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Semantic Web" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic Web</a> (see links above for how this relates), and it may also be the first year when it becomes news that data wasn&#8217;t published in a story when it should have been. That a government body isn&#8217;t being transparent or is blocking access by publishing its findings in PDF or other non-linking formats would make a very interesting story indeed. We can expect to see more and more organizations and public bodies remove their own barriers through initiatives and legislation. Examples have been set, and seeing excuses die along with barriers is not far-fetched.</p>
<p>Do you know of other data-driven stories? We&#8217;d love to hear about any insights that were made through publicly accessible data or where this data might come from next.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/2382314257_9993d2c07d_m.jpg"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 5px;" src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/2382314257_9993d2c07d_m.jpg?resize=240%2C222" alt="three" width="240" height="222" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/www.talis.com">Talis</a>, my employer, has been a big promoter of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/linkeddata.org"> Linked Data</a> and open-access to information, because we see that new ideas often arise when existing ideas come together. Innovation, if you like, occurs at the join between ideas when they connect. I see this as fundamental to the way ideas and their applications (technology) advance. I tend to believe that anything &#8220;novel&#8221; is actually affected when other ideas are connected together.</p>
<p>In the technological world, this seems like a strong analogy for Linked Data: information which can be connected by a web-like network of links. These Linked Data have become the foundation for what has come to be known as the “Semantic Web”, a web of connected information which breaks out of information silos and enables the discovery of new ideas from old, and innovation from existing information. We use the phrase &#8220;serendipitous reuse&#8221; for the idea that once an idea (or a piece of data) is published, it can be used and reused in novel ways and in context of other data to produce unexpected, and unforeseeable possibilities. These ideas (data, again) become increasingly useful when published in a format which allows them to be linked freely to ANY other piece of information. We&#8217;ve had the distribution method for this network for years (the good, ol WWW itself) and it&#8217;s been about a year since  RDF was launched by the WWW Consortium to handle the data itself. The idea is basically to give every bit of data an address (a universal address, not one subjective to a database like a cell reference), and to predicate that bit of information very much like language does. If you think of it like a language, RDF lets bits of data (nouns) to be acted upon or act upon (verbs) others (other nouns). This triple-format enables a near infinite recombination (theoretically) of any data, anywhere with an address.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the problem? Well, most of the world&#8217;s data are locked away in silos (prisoners of the cells their databases confine them to). Many organisations may wish to make use of their data in a semantic environment, and many might even embrace the Open-source nature of their data, and make it freely available to the world to recombine and use: there are always more innovations outside an organisation than within! In order to lower barriers to enter this linked data world, Talis has built a Platform with resources to host and utilise these connections, making use of semantic web standards (RDF and SPARQL, the query language of the semantic web) and a developer-friendly environment (a RESTFul API, for example).</p>
<p>However, this innovation is only possible when data are accessible. In order to further lower the barriers, Talis is now offering free access to the Platform to host public domain data. We are calling this initiative the Talis Connected Commons, and the offer is not limited to free hosting: the data access services, including access to a public SPARQL endpoint, are also freely available. To keep this data open, you will need to use either the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/1">Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License</a> or the recently launched <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/zero">Creative Commons CC0 license</a> to publish data. Anyone will then be able to freely access the stored data using the Platform services, without API keys and without usage limits.</p>
<p>There is more information available at www.talis.com/cc, where you can find detailed technical information, FAQ’s and other resources.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:left;">
<div style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img style="border: 0pt none; margin: 5px;" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/12052096_5bf806e24e.jpg?w=250" alt="my mac is cool kkkkk by yaraaa" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&#39;my mac is cool &quot;kkkkk&quot;&#39; by yaraaa</p></div>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve been blogging a bit over on Nodalities about &#8220;stuff being connected&#8221;. The idea being basically: everyone is constantly creating data—all the bits of information that can be used in abstract.  These tiny bits of information are constantly being generated by every process we undertake, from the obvious like online banking to the more obscure like driving to work (your odometer tells you how many miles you&#8217;ve gone, your on-board computer may store info about your car&#8217;s status, your satnav knows where you&#8217;re going and been, your mobile phone may know this too, the garage knows when your last service was&#8230; this list can go on and on). These data are more powerful when automated by software, and they become exponentially more useful when they are connected with other data. For example, the knowledge that £50 pounds left your account isn&#8217;t particularly helpful without a connection to that little bit of data which tells you the date of the transaction.</p>
<p>But why are some data more obscure—why don&#8217;t we even think about using some of them?</p>
<p>It may be simply because they&#8217;re not immediately useful to us, yet. We can, right now, log in to our banks and have a look at our accounts. We can shuffle and access and compare and analyse because this information is being presented to us in an easily-managed and understandable way. We have access to the raw data, and most of us have some basic understanding of why these data are important. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if readers of this blog have a spreadsheet or two with financial calculations on it, or use quicken with their balance info. We all know how important calendar events, emails, address book contacts, and bank balances are, and we have various systems to deal with them.</p>
<p>But, what do we DO with all the data we don&#8217;t currently access routinely? Well, this is where those connections come in. We can connect data together using some sort of framework, or abstract construct like a database. However, this database will need to be connected to another database (or exported to an existing one) in order for these new bits and pieces to be considered in terms of others.</p>
<p>More simply, the tools and formats we use all the time (spreadsheets, calendars, notepads, computers, odometers etc&#8230;) already exist but they don&#8217;t currently take into account the further levels of data we create. We don&#8217;t have a tool to see our car&#8217;s mileage at a certain date, so we&#8217;d need to walk out to the car, look at the odometer, and guess. The bit that&#8217;s missing is the connection—the link between information we have and a tool or another bit of data. In the previous example, we need a database to collect mileage, a connection between that and date data, and a calendar to view it—tools and data.</p>
<p>There are two sides to these software tools, though. There&#8217;s the side presented to the user, and the side that is accessed by processors and memory and software. I&#8217;ll blog more on the human-side later, but the &#8220;stuff&#8221; happens at the edge of these two coming together.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Semantic Web&#8221; works on a framework which enables any data to be easily connected to other data. Instead of sitting in a traditional <a class="zem_slink" title="Relational database management system" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/Relational_database_management_system">relational database</a>, which makes its connections based on a set of specific instructions (schemas), all the data are encoded with a bit of information identifying them to the web. In essence, each piece of data has an address, and can be pointed to much like a web site points to another. This works at various levels of granularity, so individual records can be linked very easily, allowing for applications to be written on top of these linked data. These applications can then let us analyse, manipulate, swap, and USE anything, literally, that we can link.</p>
<p>Alongside this linked data infrastructure (call it the Semantic Web, or Data Web or just the Web) is the proliferation of computing hardware. Processors and memory are being manufactured into just about anything we can buy. Thiese are all working  to take the stuff we do and &#8220;translate&#8221; it into data. Phones, cars, fridges, credit cards, clocks, scales, watches&#8230; we&#8217;re surrounded by little processors or bits of memory recording and crunching what we do. What makes this situation currently frustrating/exciting is that they currently don&#8217;t share their information, and aren&#8217;t &#8220;aware&#8221; of the potential of other computing.</p>
<p>So, what am I getting at? Well, like we&#8217;re saying over on Nodalities, hook it up! We&#8217;re getting data, that&#8217;s happening. We have the framework(s) and the distributed network (the Web), and we have decades of experience automating data-comparisons (which is all Software ever does, if you boil it down).</p>
<p>The next step is to connect it.</p>

Their list of speakers sounds fantastic, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to meeting some folks in real life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m particularly interested in this conference for its stated focus on the web community. Just have a look at the Agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li> How to grow and nurture your community</li>
<li> Work/life balance or Blood, sweat and tears: Which is the startup way?</li>
<li> Colliding Worlds: Using Jabber to make awesome web sites</li>
<li> Startups live &#8211; An interview with three new European startups</li>
<li> How to survive outside of Silicon Valley</li>
</ul>
<div>Sounds good, doesn&#8217;t it?</div>
<div>There are also &#8220;Networking Opportunities&#8221; there. These sound brilliant despite the rather corporatese description.</div>
<div>They&#8217;ve apparently got seats left, and if you book before 4th August, you save £100.</div>
<div>If you&#8217;re going, let me know—we can meet up. I can tell you a bit about myself and Talis.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p>Last week I listened to a talk by Shane Hipps, a Porsche &#8220;consumer anthropologist&#8221; turned Mennonite minister. The speaker, clearly aware of the contradictory nature of his background, made a very interesting observation about the digital age. He essentially said that we are, as a society, experiencing a shift of great magnitude in history which reflects one of the greatest changes humanity has ever experienced: literacy.</p>
<p>Moving from an oral tradition to a literate society—in which letters allow people to commit their thoughts to memory—fundamentally changed the way society and individuals thought. It freed individuals to think on their own without having to commit their ideas to the collective memory of their tribe. It also changed the ability of the social groups to sense the emotional state of its individuals, because they could now exist in an abstract, individual mindset.</p>
<p>So, agrarian societies relied on the community to remember and structure their ideas. The result of this community conceptual framework was an empathic connection between members of the community. Writing, on the other hand, allows individuals to remove themselves from the older framework and commit their thoughts to paper resulting in a loss or shift in the empathy of the culture or society. In a digital age, however, there is a new shift: one of removal to connection at a distance.</p>
<p>This concept: empathy at a distance or a digitally-connected community, made me consider the connections in the Semantic Web. The in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s of the SemWeb have been argued, discussed, debated, and explored technologically. Many blogs and sites have huge amounts of content devoted to the definitions of SPARQL and RDF. Abstractions have been published discussing the applications of this new technology. Sir Tim Berners-Lee refers to the Semantic Web as &#8216;The Web done right.&#8217;</p>
<p>But, what is being done right? Is the Semantic Web the Web done technologically right? Is it an upgrade to the existing framework or a patch to fix what was wrong? Maybe. But it makes me wonder about looking at this from a sociological or communicative perspective. The Semantic Web, technologically, is important to humanity only so far as it&#8217;s a medium for our connections.</p>
<p>So, when we make new semantic connections, and the software is increasingly able to associate us with concepts, people, items and communities (like academic institutions or or organisations); what is actually happening? People are making connections, and committing them not only to their own memories but to a community.</p>
<p>Publishing, you might argue, has been around since not that long after the first scribblings of meaning. But, publishing is one-way and narrow. A message or idea is only committed to the memories and added to the mental repertories of those who actually read the message. The same is true in a digital age (with multi-channels for &#8216;reading&#8217; such as podcasts and video also) but the distinct difference is the access to concepts and the ease of utilising or &#8216;consuming&#8217; the material. Firstly, digital goods are infinitely (in practice if not in absolute purist terms) copyable. There is no limit to the number of times you can copy and distribute an electronic text or a podcast so society does not have to wait for an idea to filter through because your dad hasn&#8217;t finished their Times crossword. Secondly, the connections made digitally (and more semantically-enriched) are increasingly collaborative. With software doing the heavy lifting in terms of data mining and content distribution, more ideas get to more people in more accessible ways.</p>
<p>Finally, although the Semantic Web is far from complete in application, the glimmers it allows us to see could have huge sociological implications. It&#8217;s the human element of the Semantic Web which makes it so exciting and so potentially disruptive. It&#8217;s possible that people, finding and synthesising ideas before feeding back their individual perspectives into the community, are increasingly able to connect with people and concepts in a more empathic way; without losing the abstract and logical abilities of the literate age.</p>
<p>Is this a new age? Undoubtedly. What will it look like? I&#8217;d say: like you and me—people.</p>
