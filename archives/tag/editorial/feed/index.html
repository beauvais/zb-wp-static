								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever had a superficial conversation suddenly run your blood cold?</p>
<p>On the short cab-ride to my hotel following FOWA (more to follow), the cab driver was explaining the extension of the conference venue. This is not usually the preamble to a conversation that changes your perspectives, except maybe on the architectural uses of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/2308811412">steel spider&#8217;s legs and concrete</a>. However, he was saying that the folks that bought Manchester United (<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/L1425234.php">actually, he should have said City</a>), bought the Excel centre for a $1billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently,&#8221; said the cabby, &#8220;they do a lot of, you know, &#8216;God conferences&#8217;, evangelical like, yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221; I enquired—shocked because I&#8217;d been greeted by some charismatics in red teeshirts on my first visit to FOWA, and they&#8217;d been there every morning, greeting folks entering the conference and—strangely—leaving the toilets.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/1380640085_4192fb838b.jpg?resize=206%2C154"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 5px;" title="religion" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/1380640085_4192fb838b.jpg?resize=206%2C154" alt="" width="206" height="154" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>&#8220;Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of money in it over in the States. Folks that run &#8217;em want to come to England, and get some British God-money, I guess. Problem for them is: there aren&#8217;t any places big enough! So, they buy it, and are building a bigger place. Lots of dosh!&#8221;</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I had cynically been thinking to myself that the red-tee-shirted cohort of pentecostals greeting me by name (no, nothing spiritual—we all wear name-tags!) had been selected for their good looks and ethnic diversity. But I thought I was being cynical.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: I overheard maybe ten conversations between geeks (It was a web conference, after all) about the &#8220;religious people/ god-folk/ Christian nutters&#8221;, and my heart sank. One or two said that a cheery greeting first thing in the morning is quite nice. Most, however, thought they were over-bearing, weird, or strangely sexy.</p>
<p>The thing that gets me here, is that the public image of Jesus&#8217; followers is horribly maimed here. Wasn&#8217;t it Jesus who through money-changers out of the temple? Wasn&#8217;t it Jesus who went to societies low-lifes and changed their worlds? You think he would have scored well with a PR agency? Think he had a Marketing team or cheer-leaders?</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing spiritual they [Arab investors in the venue] get is this:&#8221; and the cabby rubbed his fingers in the international symbol of money.</p>
<p>What should I say to this? I&#8217;m lost for words&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always had a love/hate relationship with sleep. I can remember being so upset I couldn&#8217;t sleep because I had to go to bed. Maybe this has bled into the present.</p>
<p>The funny part of it all, is I&#8217;d much rather not be asleep most of the time. My wife has always confused me with her desire, pretty continuously, to be unconscious. There is so much to think about, to read, to play, to discuss—why sleep?</p>
<p>So, now, it&#8217;s 2:15. I know that tomorrow I will feel wretched, and that can&#8217;t help. It started by me so very nearly falling asleep around 11:00. It&#8217;s been boiling, and I don&#8217;t really get on well with hot weather—especially when it&#8217;s so humid. I thought I had it tonight, though, with a nice cool bath, then In bed at a reasonable time to watch My Family with Wendy on <a class="zem_slink" title="BBC iPlayer" rel="homepage" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iplayer">iPlayer</a>. That ended, so I switched on &#8220;Just a Minute&#8221; and turned down the screen until it was dark. I dozed off towards the end, only to be woken by something beeping somewhere. It stopped, but the damage had been done.</p>
<p>Next I switched on &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Quote... Unquote" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/Quote..._Unquote">Quote, Unquote</a>&#8221; and walked downstairs for a glass of water, and had a bottle of lager instead, hoping the little alcohol might help a bit. It&#8217;s so much cooler down stairs, so I decided to remove myself to the sofa, still with &#8220;Quote, Unquote&#8221;. I had just settled when my phone dinged. It had finally delivered a message to Wendy, I&#8217;d sent before dinner. Then, after settling in again, Wendy&#8217;s phone received the text message. Her phone, a new one, now beeps every few minutes until the message&#8217;s been read&#8230; another trip across the room.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when it started raining: by now I&#8217;m 15-minutes deep in Gardener&#8217;s Question Time. At last, it&#8217;s cooling off. Then it starts with the Thunder—which I have always hated. This rain literally poured down, and the thunder went through the house with a shuddering thud.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Gardeners' Question Time" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/Gardeners%27_Question_Time">Gardeners&#8217; Question Time</a> gave way to &#8220;Word of Mouth&#8221;, which I can&#8217;t remember. By then I was feeling anxious, about literally nothing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the oddest feeling: beginning like discomfort, then a physical sensation in my arms. Finally, I can&#8217;t be horizontal any longer, and it&#8217;s another walk across to the smaller settee. I can&#8217;t actually put a thought to this ridiculous anxiety. I&#8217;m not scared about anything, really. My job&#8217;s brilliant, my mates are fantastic, and my Wife&#8217;s amazing. Sure, not everything&#8217;s perfect, but I&#8217;m not even thinking about my painful back or where I&#8217;m at with God or any of the other possible panic producers.</p>
<p>I decided to share, and it seems to help. The thunder&#8217;s past, my arms don&#8217;t feel funny, and I&#8217;m not worried at nothing. It&#8217;s just this strange, almost twilight of the night: 2:32. I ache a bit, which isn&#8217;t good, and I feel like moaning online is a bit sad.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d hate to meet me in the morning.</p>
