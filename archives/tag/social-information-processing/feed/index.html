								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- #BeginTags --><!-- #EndTags --> For avid news readers, not much beats a classic broadsheet newspaper for quality content and writership. Although I use <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/reader">Google Reader</a> to keep up with the best of the blogs, and sometimes skim <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/www.digg.com">Digg</a> for new reads, I keep coming back to the consistent content found on traditional newspapers&#8211;online. That isn&#8217;t to say that everything found at a &#8216;proper&#8217; news site beats everything on a new media service or a blog. Indeed, many blogs have amazingly-tuned insights and offer the best rants on the planet. But, when you want general news, looking through the often opined views of one-man blogs can be a headache. Much blog content is very focused, and most Digg and Technorati articles lean towards the geeky. I landed some time ago at the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/news">Times Online</a> and frequently browse its headlines.</p>
<p>The Times Online has some of my favourite columnists and consistently high-quality comment. Who can resist a rant or opinion from <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/jeremy_clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a>? Alongside, Lord Rees-Mogg and his ilk of commentators whose opinion I have come to respect (if not always with 100% agreement!) However, I do have a few problems with the Times Online. There is, actually, only one major complaint.</p>
<h3>It is so slow!</h3>
<p>It boasts its Windows links and utilizes &#8220;Live Search&#8221; instead of Google, and I wonder if this architecture is what makes it so mind-numbingly time-consuming. Its content is well-positioned and not as graphic heavy as many sites whose load-time is much faster (check out <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/www.topgear.com">Top Gear</a> for an example of a slow site which is faster!). If you want to view many articles in a single sitting and open up multiple tabs (as I am prone to do) You will find them still loading long after you&#8217;ve made a cuppa. I find the layout pleasing, and the ease of navigating its absoultely vast content brilliant; but I can&#8217;t get over how slowly I have to navigate these pages. It also doesn&#8217;t seem to like Firefox very much (thanks Windows integration?). If you have any better news sites, let me know. It is still worth a look, though, for it simply houses some of the best news content online!</p>
