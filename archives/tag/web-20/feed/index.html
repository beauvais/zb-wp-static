								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2347375591"><img class="alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2347375591_58294180f4_m.jpg?resize=240%2C161" alt="Noob" width="240" height="161" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Following a tweeted link to “the funniest comment thread ever”, I spent a few minutes laughing at the expense of hundreds of confused Facebookers. They had been leaving comments on a ReadWriteWeb blog <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php">post</a> about a recent venture with AOL to share login access. It took me a few seconds to get the joke: there were scores of comments like:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new facebook sucks&gt; NOW LET ME IN.</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>please give me back the old facebook login this is crazy……………..</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>All I want to do is log in, this sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the RWW team confirmed in the comment thread that these were genuine: that the traffic was coming from Google referrals using search terms like “facebook login”.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Facebook users googled for the Facebook login page and, landing on RWW’s post, left comments expressing how frustrated they were with the new layout and their inability to login.</p>
<p>Even after RWW put up the following message in the post, people continued to complain:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear visitors from Google. This site is not Facebook. This is a website called ReadWriteWeb that reports on news about Facebook and other Internet services. You can however click here and become a Fan of ReadWriteWeb on Facebook, to receive our updates and learn more about the Internet. To access Facebook right now, click here. For future reference, type “facebook.com” into your browser address bar or enter “facebook” into Google and click on the first result. We recommend that you then save Facebook as a bookmark in your browser.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is hugely funny, until it becomes sad.</p>
<p>After a few pages of befuddled (and often abusive) lost Facebookers, the comments started to contain more genuine commenters observing their enjoyment of the confusion, trollbaiting, and teasing the confused crowd. Some were genuinely clever (<em>likes</em>), but many followed the basic forum trajectory of ridicule.</p>
<p>What struck me, however, was my own ignorance in this. I had <em>no</em> idea just how many people rely on services like Facebook who don’t have even a basic grasp of how they’re doing it. The fundamental “browser” metaphor makes it pretty clear that you need to “be” a certain place in order for things to work the way you expect them to. Even without some form of teaching, that level seems too obvious not to get.</p>
<p>But it clearly isn’t. The implications are potentially worrying. Hundreds of people were able to leave comments on a site that wasn’t their destination stating their outrage and confusion. One commentator made a good point about them being lucky that ReadWriteWeb is a relatively benign place to accidentally land; but what if this were a post about Wells Fargo or a health insurance company?</p>
<p>Like many near-geeks, I’ve helped friends and family on technical issues in the past, and there is a level of assessment involved: Where do I need to start to get them using this? But nothing prepared me for this.</p>
<p>This may be hilariously funny, and it might be disconcerting, but it’s most definitely a lesson.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/twitter_banned_from_white_house.php">read</a> yesterday that twitter has been banned from the White House. In the post, Marshall Kirkpatrick joked that this could be a reason we haven&#8217;t seen much from Obama&#8217;s twitter stream recently. I must admit however, my initial reaction was sympathetic with the White House for pragmatic reasons, though the attitude of the Press Secretary&#8217;s attitude towards &#8220;twitterers&#8221; did raise the hackles. It makes sense to be secure in the White House, to make sure people aren&#8217;t saying things which could be dangerous or cause scandal through carelessness. &#8220;Loose lips sink ships&#8221;, don&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>But I think there is a wider idea here, which I think I&#8217;ve glimpsed between the lines.</p>

I use it to pass on little observations, like you might to a room full of mates, when there isn&#8217;t anyone there to share with directly. News of Michael Jackson&#8217;s death reached me via an off-colour joke on twitter. These are uses for a technology which it would be difficult to commend.</p>
<p>However, I also use twitter to share news. When my grandfather recently passed away, I received dozens of messages of encouragement and sympathy. Several of us here in Shropshire organise a monthly get together to network and discuss tech-trends and the work we do through the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/shropgeek">@shropgeek</a>. Important announcements at work, and shared interest groups often rely on twitter for their spread and response, and I&#8217;ve had customer service reps from big companies personally respond to my feedback. Of far more significance, the government of Iran was unable to stop twitter, allowing its citizens to tell the rest of the world what was going on when all other forms of communication were censored, blocked, or monitored. And citizens from around the rest of the world responded.</p>
<p>twitter is a medium, and suggesting someone is petty and fatuous because they use it is like suggesting everyone on TV is unimportant or vain. There is no connection between the inane talk-show host and the investigative journalist or head of state! The point is in the message, not the vehicle. But, the point this raises in my mind is that twitter, and other forms of web-enabled channels make for a high level of transparency, and I don&#8217;t think the US (in particular) is a power who likes transparency at the moment.</p>
<p>This has lead me to question what I think of the use of web-media by politicians and important figures, particularly in the US and UK. It makes me wonder whether the &#8220;Loose lips&#8221; philosophy is misguided in the modern world. You see, closing channels, blocking communication, and monitoring messages suggests a democracy that doesn&#8217;t trust its citizens with the truth. Sure, there are controls and securities which must be in place, and I&#8217;m not suggesting for a moment that every clerk should have a constitutional right to twitter state-secrets&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;or am I?</p>
<p>You see, the United States is global super-power on par with, and probably only directly comparable with great states of the past called Empires. The notion of an emperor of the US would chill the blood of most of my family, and thinking of the US as anything but a &#8220;democracy&#8221; is practically heresy. After all, citizens&#8217; rights are ensconced in the very foundation myth and history of the US itself. &#8220;We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal&#8230;&#8221; begins a letter to a despotic monarch, sparking off the touch-pad for liberating men from the rule of figureheads, class and social bondage. But part of this very myth* that the Republic, &#8220;of the people, by the people and for the people&#8221; should be based on citizenship trusted to look after themselves and even take up arms to defend their status as such citizens. There is a deep-running notion in the American psyche that if the government were ever to get too big for it&#8217;s boots, it is the right—nay, duty—of her citizens to act to reduce her power.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t believe the US is a state that can be corrected by its citizens very effectively at all.  I think of the complexity, size, presence and byzantine nature of the US Government, and I feel disconnected, small, and powerless to change anything. Over the past decade, in the name of security, Americans put up with reductions in liberty, and I think this principle is bleeding through the cracks in the facade of governance. Blocking channels is saying: &#8220;we don&#8217;t trust you&#8221;.</p>
<p>What would a country look like where the public had access to the vast majority of government information? Where government officially made use of the media its citizens used? Where government officials were held accountable via the various media whenever they were caught being mis-represented?</p>
<p>Oddly, I think it&#8217;s the UK.</p>
<p>The &#8220;traditional&#8221; media here are a powerful force. It is seen as a near human right to have intimate news of public officials and dealings, and watching politicians being interviewed by members of the press is like eaves-dropping on a job interview or witnessing a cautious father&#8217;s first meeting of a prospective suitor for his only daughter. The press is a force to be reckoned with here, and it&#8217;s not seen as the trustworthy force itself, but is is composed of citizens, not officials.</p>
<p>Does this scandalise the government? Yes&#8230; and no. There is a very different attitude toward elected officials here, which doesn&#8217;t translate easily to American. A Member of Parliament is legally referred to as &#8220;Honourable Member&#8221;, but the &#8220;honourable&#8221; is not taken as read by the average Brit. For decades, for example, Members of Parliament have enjoyed a system of expenses whereby they can claim for nearly every cost of living: from second homes to food and utilities. The true level of this feeding-trough has recently been blown wide by the press (who subsequently have been enjoying their own self-congratulatory feast, but that is another post.)</p>
<p>But, I think the UK get the web, probably because it&#8217;s used to dealing with powerful media. I follow Number 10 Downing Street (the metonymic residence of the Prime Minister) on twitter. No 10 doesn&#8217;t say much, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to expose any state secrets, but I like the fact that it&#8217;s there to be engaged. The Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) hosts an important blog which outlines the government&#8217;s plans to expose public data for normal, every-day citizens to have a play with and to see what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>And, in the last few weeks, the Prime Minister himself has turned himself around almost 180º in my personal opinion. He represents a party for whom I have less time than either of the other major contenders, and I&#8217;ve rather lazily accepted him as an incompetent oaf. But, he&#8217;s finally earned my pint and invite to dinner, if not my vote (if any of his secretaries are reading this, just tweet your acceptance, and I&#8217;ll find some pheasants and Pinotage). A few weeks ago, he appointed Sir Tim Berners-Lee to a Parliamentary advisory role with the explicit intention of opening up and pushing public data online. This is a <strong>major</strong> point, because it leads to transparency through public accountability. There seems to be a movement for Parliament to see public data as belonging to the people who bought it with their taxes, and this seems to be the most democratic way to see it. His recent <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/gordon_brown.html">TED talk</a> also made me think he&#8217;s got a lot more to say than he perhaps has to date; though I think many of his points raise more questions than they answer.</p>
<p>Much has been said in the online world about the new American administration&#8217;s use of social media and the web to mobilise supporters during the election. But there hasn&#8217;t been much since. President Obama launched <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/www.data.gov">data.gov</a>, but there is very little data there. I think the web is seen as a tool for messages, as a part of a bigger campaign, and as a security breach. It&#8217;s something to be used with your own agenda, and only under one&#8217;s own strict parameters. And, perhaps most non-democratically, it&#8217;s been used to broadcast and to cajole—It has not been used to engage. The fact that social media have barely been touched since the election could point to a wider attitude that citizens only matter for the brief time they&#8217;re required to vote.</p>
<p>The UK has already exposed much of its public data, and it&#8217;s planning to publish more and more as Linked Data (machine-readable, immediately useful resources), and it&#8217;s made plans to be more open, grasping the web and the transparency it&#8217;s brought through the hard lessons that spin is impossible with a well-informed citizenry, and on the Open Web, there is less room for your own message than there is for humanity.</p>
<p>*<em>mythos is greek for &#8220;story&#8221;, and it is from that perspective I use the word <em>myth</em>: that it conveys the notion of a commonly-held understanding, not that it is entirely fantastic or without truth.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p><a class="alignright" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/343290180"><img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 5px" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/343290180_8655cc0b74_m.jpg?w=1090" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The tech world is telling a story about the Web and computing, and the mainstream media seem to be catching on. They&#8217;re hearing about clouds, wikis, and the history of the World-wide Web. The whole thing reads like some sort of legend&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>It was an era, long ago, when the folk of Middle Class plugged in their Mo-Dems and listened to arcane, magical sounds as their £120 beige box enabled a blazing 14.4 kb/s connection, and they only had to wait a few minutes to call forth script and from anywhere on earth. It was an age that saw the beginnings of email, where people composed messages and sent them down the phone lines at lightning speeds (unless a packet dropped&#8230;). This was the time of Web 1.0.</p>
<p>Then, the web collapsed. No one used the internet any more. Modems became paperweights and millions of metres of ethernet cable were grubbed up to make room for under-floor heat in offices. The world was quiet, and the people of Middle Class forgot what they knew.</p>
<p>Until, there dawned the advent of Web 2.0. People re-learned their former ways, and improved upon the innovations of their fathers. Instead of sites and pages, they began to use &#8220;Web Apps&#8221; which accomplished Tasks, and they became their masters. The great titan Google was made, and he knew all and directed the world toward knowledge. The elves of the web taught men the ways of blogging and messenging and eventually (when they&#8217;d mastered all these things with wiki-training to boot) Social Media and Networking.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Only, that&#8217;s not exactly how it happened; is it? Many commentators and Alpha Geeks have divided the story of the web into convenient phases, and they&#8217;ve roughly settled around a versioning metaphor common to software. Have a look at your favorite browser, and you&#8217;ll see a version number (Safari 4 for me, if you&#8217;re interested) which lets you know how many iterations have been and gone before. There are certainly noted differences, and turning points, where people phased out their dependence on one thing for the convenience and utility of something better. Tim O&#8217;Reilly, who coined the phrase Web 2.0, wrote a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/what-is-web-20.html">much-linked post</a> in 2005 trying to explain and crystalise some of the trends he was seeing which were different from the first few years of the web. The fact that he had to clarify what he meant, and that it took the non-geek world three years to catch up testifies to the notion that the change was gradual. It makes me think that we missed out all the .1-.10&#8217;s in the version numbers, and many alpha and beta tests along the way.</p>
<p>Now we are engaged in the great Web 3.0, where we are applying the logic of the past to the present and guessing at the future. Only, because no one is actually releasing versions of the web like a good, reliable software company should, the story is much more complicated—and interesting!</p>
<p>There are notable trends, with backers and bloggers riding various waves. But it seems to me that the point of this is a convergence. The mobile web is bringing new sorts of information to people, and they can make use of this info wherever they happen to be because of advances in devices ad connectivity. As phones and web-enabled devices get better, so to do the chips we seem to have embedded all over the place, and we can now begin to have a more clear picture of what we do through the information we gather from our heaters, cars, and pedometers. Also, as more objects become connected, the grunt-work of number-crunching and storage is becoming commoditized into big, efficient, utility-like cloud services, which host and work with our collected information much more effectively than the gadget in your hand could ever hope to do. Others, like ourselves, talk about the Semantic Web, which allows for an evolution from a bunch of connected documents to the explicit connections between bits of information.</p>
<p>But, I see a trend there which is common to all candidates: information. The web allowed for information to be shared, then collaboratively worked. Now, I see this information becoming useful in and of itself&#8230;as data.</p>
<p>Walt Mossberg <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/welcome-to-web-30">talks about Web 3.0</a> as if it is riding on the backs of mobile and connected devices. And I think it probably is. Tim Berners-Lee recently <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8090538.stm">spoke to the BBC</a> about the future of the web including some incredible future of pixels everywhere, where any surface could display information. He&#8217;s also repeatedly talked about the future of the web being semantic (he invented the term, let&#8217;s not forget) where Linked Data is the web done right. And who am I to argue with the inventor of the Web?</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s so much a conflict or competition as a coming together here. If there will be a Web 3.0 (and it seems a likely, media-friendly label), I think it will include all of these trends centred around the focus of data. The connected devices allow us access to cloud-computing and storage (computing and storage of data&#8230;). Many chips gather data about ourselves, which we can use to personalise our view on the web of data, and the Linking of this data through semantics lets it all be calculable, programmable, and useful. It kind of reminds me of a computer, you know&#8230; The chips and our collective use of web applications are input and sources, and the various devices we use are displays and UI&#8217;s onto a massive, scalable CPU in the cloud. Linked Data could be the Operating System, allowing and enabling anything to be connected and programmed.</p>
<p>Web 3.0, to me, is a convergence of the trends, and it&#8217;s all about data. It&#8217;s not a simple story, and any convenient label is to convenient to be comprehensive, but I&#8217;m pretty sure the next things will all  centre on our ability to make use of and personalise vast chunks of previously-obtuse data.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m introducing old friends; but <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> is a &#8220;microbloggiing&#8221; platform, to give it its proper description. it gives users 140 characters to publish status updates, comments, gripes, complaints, praises, news and whatever comes to mind. It&#8217;s burst out of its original answer to the simple question: &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; and users often tweet just about everything.</p>
<p>One interesting innovation is the integration of the hashtag. Simply a hash symbol (#) and a tag descriptor for the comment. This gives people the ability to follow particular threads of updates or participate in conversations around an interest. They&#8217;re often used, for example, to update the goings on from conferences (#FOWA for example). People give their own content this little bit of information, and a search engine can find them. People can add additional information and follow conventions which allow for distributed trends that anyone can follow and interact with.</p>
<p>The recent snowfall in Britain gave rise to a flurry of tweets about road closures, amounts of snow falling, schools closing down and all the other chaos unleashed. When users followed a simple convention, however, this information got organised. People quickly adopted the #uksnow hashtag to track the topic; and eventually someone worked out a way to capture all the info needed to follow these geographically. By tweeting the first half of a UK post code plus a rating out of ten snowfall, anyone following the thread knows exactly where it&#8217;s snowing. It&#8217;s like an instant weather polling station, distributed across the country. It can go a step further, however, when services can actually mashup these tweets when users turn their simple status updates into a mini line of code.</p>
<p>This little bit of information allows for people to write software to track and automate the twitter information. This <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/snow">interactive map</a> from benmarsh.co.uk, for example, actually plots a visual graph of snowfall across Britain. Bigger snowflakes indicate larger numbers out of ten in the poll. It&#8217;s simple, really. Ingenious, possibly. But the fundamental distinction between this tracking ability and the noise of thousands of Twits shouting about the snow is that little bit of metadata.</p>
<p>So, is this use of twitter a metaphor for the Semantic Web? It&#8217;s certainly a picture of automating information flow using metadata via software. Sounds Semanticcy to me.</p>

Their list of speakers sounds fantastic, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to meeting some folks in real life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m particularly interested in this conference for its stated focus on the web community. Just have a look at the Agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li> How to grow and nurture your community</li>
<li> Work/life balance or Blood, sweat and tears: Which is the startup way?</li>
<li> Colliding Worlds: Using Jabber to make awesome web sites</li>
<li> Startups live &#8211; An interview with three new European startups</li>
<li> How to survive outside of Silicon Valley</li>
</ul>
<div>Sounds good, doesn&#8217;t it?</div>
<div>There are also &#8220;Networking Opportunities&#8221; there. These sound brilliant despite the rather corporatese description.</div>
<div>They&#8217;ve apparently got seats left, and if you book before 4th August, you save £100.</div>
<div>If you&#8217;re going, let me know—we can meet up. I can tell you a bit about myself and Talis.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BBC reported a few days ago that:</p>
<blockquote><p><a>Web users are getting more ruthless and selfish when they go online, reveals research.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The idea is that people are using the web to get things done, and don’t seem to notice that service providers want them to stick around. They even get tetchy with intrusions or ‘widgets’.</p>
<p>I agree, to a certain extent, with this statement—that people are impatient with adverts on sites. However, I’m not sure if I feel this article is that well informed. Yes, it is backed by Jakob Nielsen (so-called “Usability Guru”); which means it’s founded on stable research etc&#8230;</p>
<p>But, what’s a widget if not a short-cut to a result? An Amazon widget on a site is basically a way to buy a product without the need even to visit Amazon.co.uk. I don’t think it’s helpful to lump all widgets together on this one. Most widgets are functional—In fact, I’d go so far as to say that a non-functional widget is just a banner-ad.</p>
<p>It IS annoying when your browsing is interrupted with a flash game or advert placing itself over your text or form. It doesn’t help me make a decision, and actually puts me off that particular site. The Times Online had a long-running Land Rover ad which drove over the page, stopping me from reading. Since when is a Land Rover Discovery 3 an impulse buy?</p>
<p>What this article fails to notice is that users are doing exactly what they’re supposed to do: <em>use</em>. The internet is usable now. People can think to themselves: “I’d quite like to buy an iPod, right now.” Within a minute, they can have a confirmation email and estimated delivery date in their inbox. This is using the web, and I think it’s not so much a ‘ruthless’ thing or a ‘selfish’ thing. You expect to buy what you’d like in a supermarket, and no one would call you ruthless for not setting up camp there for the afternoon. I know I like to spend as little time in Tesco as possible, and I don’t think anyone who considers me selfish or ruthless does so on account of that.</p>
<p>This is actually an issue of usability and confidence. People are more confident in their ability to purchase, find information, and network online. The majority of my book, electronic, and increasingly household purchases are done on amazon.co.uk. I check my calendar on Google before confirming appointments, and I even check people’s statuses on Facebook to see how they are. This is confident, comfortable use. I don’t need to spend an hour on a site when I can get the info I need in my RSS reader (Vienna, it’s brilliant!), but I still want the content.</p>
<p>I’m also still open to relevant advertising&#8230; If I’m after an iPod, I don’t mind being shown iPod accessories, especially discounted ones. I don’t mind being recommended a new book by a previously-read author. But, I do mind being shouted at by banner-ads and I tend to ignore them.</p>
<p>Having worked in online marketing, I couldn’t imagine a less-useful tactic than plastering your content with splashy ads and irrelevant content. It’s not helpful or usable, and goes against the grain of how the web works. It’s an open garden, and it’s rude to litter. This does not mean we’re ruthless, we’re just getting better at keeping our spaces clear and useful.</p>
<p>There’s the bin, put your Flash-ads in on your way out of our park, mate.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read about sliderocket over on <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/look_out_powerpoint_sliderocke.php" target="_blank">R/WW</a>, and at ZDNet, today, and signed up for a Beta. While I&#8217;m waiting for them to send one out (I hope) I&#8217;d like to talk a little about why I love the idea of this product.</p>
<p>Firstly, I was recently tasked with conducting a 40-minute presentation. This is something I was quite excited to do, since it was about the Semantic Web, but I didn&#8217;t have any presentation software on my PC. I downloaded a copy of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/www.openoffice.org" target="_blank">OpenOffice</a>, which has a presentation application built in, and found it ironically bland for an app called &#8216;Impress&#8217;. I know, as a person of geekish persuasion (I&#8217;m only half-geek, on my father&#8217;s side) I shouldn&#8217;t give a toss about what an application looks like, but should focus entirely on what it does and how well. But this <em>is</em> a presentation&#8211;aesthetics is what the software was written for. I&#8217;m not crunching numbers or writing code, I&#8217;m standing up in front of people discussing an exciting topic, trying to put forward a well-polished talk. I want my slides to reflect that&#8211;they need to add to the talk, and they can&#8217;t do that if they&#8217;re boring.</p>
<p>Not only this, but I find OpenOffice&#8217;s Impress seemed to have loads of options in random places, and a difficult-to-follow system of preferences. It has dozens of background settings, but it&#8217;s like pulling teeth to get a gradient you like.</p>
<p>Eventually, I downloaded a trial of Microsoft&#8217;s Powerpoint 2007 and found it much, much better. It&#8217;s easy to use, simple-to-navigate, and aesthetically pleasing. It&#8217;s huge downside, however, is that it&#8217;s expensive.</p>
<p>Now, having seen sliderocket&#8217;s site, and had a look at their demo presentation, I&#8217;m struck by three things. First, it&#8217;s gorgeous! The actual presentation is stunning, and eye-catching and flawless. This is desperately important for a presentation app.</p>
<p>Secondly, because it&#8217;s a web app, it can incorporate web-features natively. Granted, I find it hard to think why I&#8217;d need a hyperlink in a presentation (I&#8217;m there, pointing to it, after all), but it offers import assets from Flickr and other web-tools. This is a huge step towards a semantic-type application which could use the very latest information in a presentation (live stock reports, automatically-updated images, up-to-date contact information for companies&#8230;).</p>
<p>Finally, this is platform agnostic. It&#8217;s on the web, so you can use it on the web. Although there is an offline reader for download, you can play it using just flash seamlessly. No longer will you have to make sure the place&#8217;s projector will talk to your laptop (or like me, that the laptop they provide has a reader for your presentation ;~)). It&#8217;ll run on Linux, Mac, and Windows!</p>
<p>There is one, only one, concern of mine, though, That&#8217;s that when you click to advance a slide, your curser turns into a clock and you have a bit of a delay. This could be incredibly annoying for time-critical presentations or animations. We&#8217;ll just have to see how well this bears out in a trial, though.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve added a lightbox photo gallery to the site, if you ever want to have a look at random images they&#8217;re there. There&#8217;s also a link in the navigation bar. I&#8217;m liking this new blog, it&#8217;s easier to use and integrates better with Windows Live Writer&#8230; except the visual styles&#8230; typical.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Live Writer</h3>
<p>Right, so I&#8217;ve been blogging using Windows Live Writer for a few weeks, and have generally enjoyed it. It&#8217;s easier than logging into my CMS, and it integrates with the site theme, so what I see is actually what the post looks like.</p>
<p>As you can see, it&#8217;s a pretty slick interface, and I think it&#8217;s  relatively simple, so the focus is on the writing rather than the application (Windows&#8217; biggest design fault IMHO!) There are a few exasperatives, however:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Insert Video</em> only works with a select set of video sources, and I even had trouble with YouTube. It&#8217;s a slick idea, but it executes poorly.</li>
<li>My Site favicon appears, which is nice, but it runs over &#8216;View Weblog&#8217; and falls off the bottom of the window. Surely it&#8217;s not too hard to resize or align it in a satisfactory way?</li>
<li>Set-up was quick, but there&#8217;s no native support for Drupal (you have to cheat and call it WordPress or MetaWebLog). This isn&#8217;t so bad, but it does limit the options you&#8217;re given if you choose the wrong one.</li>
<li>It has the ability to tag posts, but it calls them &#8216;Categories&#8217;. They&#8217;re Tags. It&#8217;s a Blog. And, it&#8217;s one of the things that doesn&#8217;t work if you choose the wrong set-up type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from those, it&#8217;s brilliant. I use it all the time, and it is easy to use. You just have to html-in the videos you want. And, like I said, it&#8217;s pretty.</p>
<h2>Live Mail</h2>
<p>I hate Outlook. It&#8217;s ugly, complicated, and runs slowly and in its own very particular way. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s brilliant for all you Server-Oriented people out there, but I don&#8217;t use Exchange. I&#8217;ve been using Gmail&#8217;s web interface for three years or so, and decided I&#8217;d like to explore a desktop app. I set up Outlook 2003, but I hate it so much&#8230; Besides, I use Google Calendar, and I haven&#8217;t got a satisfactory sync yet (Yes, I <em>have</em> added <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/google-calendar-sync.html" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s new Sync app</a>, but I use multiple calendars&#8230;) You have to muck about with the OS&#8217;s Mail settings to get rid of unwanted accounts. Then it crashed, cause I deleted it&#8217;s precious Data File&#8230;  so, Outlook&#8217;s out. Instinctively, I&#8217;d use Thunderbird, but it isn&#8217;t as good as Firefox for some reason, and I don&#8217;t want to think of Mozilla in a bad way&#8230; (Whoever said I was unbiased?)</p>
<p>Thing is, I like the OS integration of things I use all the time, I just don&#8217;t like Window&#8217;s versions. I like the Idea of Internet Explorer, but Firefox is better in so many ways. I like the idea of Windows Contacts, but it doesn&#8217;t grab my contacts from the Cloud&#8230; like Plaxo used to before it broke! So I love the idea of Windows Live Mail&#8230; it&#8217;s eye candy Aero style and looks simple, to contrast Outlook&#8217;s frankly cluttered layout.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it works simple too. Not simple as in <em>keep it simple</em>, but  simple as in: &#8216;He <em>was</em> a bit simple, now you mention it.&#8217; IMAP frankly frightens it, and you have to use advanced settings to keep it from defaulting to POP. My favourite thing about it so far, though, is the way it mindlessly keeps doing what I tell it not to. I don&#8217;t want it to synchronise the &#8216;All Mail&#8217; folder with Google, cause it&#8217;s colossal. I don&#8217;t want it to sync the spam folder, cause it&#8217;s full of spam and I&#8217;m happy with my c0k $iz£, thanks! But it keeps doing it. I tell it not to synchronise, and even remove it&#8217;s messages; they keep appearing. And I know it remembers what I told it because the tick box is still ticked (it&#8217;s not the only thing getting a ticking off) (See Image).</p>
<p>It also doesn&#8217;t seem connected with its tray icon, which still displays unread mail long after you&#8217;ve read and cleared the inbox.</p>
<p>For some positives, it&#8217;s pretty, not complicated, and it has a structure which works better than Outlook. It supports a big, one-stop inbox without needing a BSc (Hons): <em>Outlook Settings and Apologetics</em>. I like it, I just wish it worked like it should. Kinda&#8230; like <em>Vista!</em></p>
<h2><em>Update</em></h2>
<p>It looks like Live Writer has updated and now recognises Drupal. Unfortunately, it now sees the CSS in a different way, and makes posting very visually difficult! It used to have  a white background (See top image) but now looks like this:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nightmare to read&#8230; oh well, I can&#8217;t really be arsed to muck about with the CSS of my theme&#8230; it was fun while it lasted!</p>
