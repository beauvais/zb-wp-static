								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so I thought I&#8217;d try something. I thought I&#8217;d try writing an entire post on an iPhone. I&#8217;ve downloaded an app&#8230; Think it&#8217;s ingeniously called something like &#8220;blog writer&#8221;. I can tell that my typically long-winded style and use of punctuation will be a killer here! </p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, this feels easy. Whether that&#8217;s the second pint talking, however, would require further experimentation. </p>
<p>I should say: it&#8217;s easy enough to TYPE. Thinking at the same time, I feel, will take some time. So, my devoted reader, you&#8217;re in for a treat of mindlessness&#8230; </p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s as well getting used to using mobile interfaces, I think. With it being this painless to finally BE online through such a small portal leads me to think it&#8217;ll be a limited time before this is the default for simply connecting.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t THAT easy&#8230; It is so very much faster to type. But, this is fine, and it&#8217;ll only get better. However, there are some things which are necessary for this to be my default: </p>
<p>*I need the use of all my fingers. This screen is fantastically good-and I find it very much better as an interface even than my beloved trackball. But the keyboard&#8230; It&#8217;s too slow.</p>
<p>*Faster app switching. This will surely improve with time, but it&#8217;s a bit of a train-of-thought killer.</p>
<p>*Copy/paste. I mean: Come On!</p>
<p>*Finally, the way to navigate among text is to hold one&#8217;s finger somewhere near the text, and drop the resulting cursor somewhere near the letter. Arrows alongside this would be very useful. </p>
<p>So, there you have it: my first iPhone post. Not sure I&#8217;ll rush out to to it again. But it&#8217;s possible. I need more practice with the interface, but I&#8217;m not sure if I will. </p>
<p>One last thought: there&#8217;s limited to no file handling. This is a mistake, I think. I would very much hate to lose this much thumb-written text now&#8230;</p>
