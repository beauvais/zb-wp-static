								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/5288168443"><img class="alignleft" alt="Tablet" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/5288168443_0eb8499505_m.jpg?w=1090" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The more I use it, the more conflicted I am about the iPad. It&#8217;s bright and renders images beautifully. I love the way designers are now taking this big screen into account when they produce apps like <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/products">Pulse</a> news reader and <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/frypaper-an-interview-with-the-man-behind-stephen-frys-ipad-app/">FryPaper</a>. It&#8217;s really fun for showing photos to people.</p>
<p>But—and there are so very many buts—it&#8217;s not brilliant for writing or taking notes. It&#8217;s super fast on slideshows, but takes ages to type, correct, select, copy, and paste. Editing text is still annoying after weeks of practice.</p>
<p>Blogging, as I&#8217;m doing now, keeps reminding me how much easier this would be on my trusty laptop. That image I want to use isn&#8217;t quite right, so I&#8217;ll skip it. What I won&#8217;t do is try to find a good image editor app that actually doesn&#8217;t resize, then find another that does but hides the file somewhere I&#8217;ll never see it deep in the workings of the iPad, I assume. So i won&#8217;t do that&#8230;again.</p>
<p>Dedicated apps can be brilliant, but the ones for services I use aren&#8217;t always. The WordPress app, for example, is terrible. There isn&#8217;t an iPad version of the excellent tumblr app for iPhone at all. So, for most things, it&#8217;s site-based tools missing letters like tumblr and flickr. But these don&#8217;t always render well, and if they need Flash, you&#8217;re obviously stuffed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also just discovered that I can&#8217;t scroll within a frame. This means that I can&#8217;t edit—or even see—the text I&#8217;ve typed here. So I&#8217;ll have to trust that it&#8217;s ok. (It isn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve switched to my laptop, and have corrected a typo and fixed a missing markdown link.)</p>
<p>More often than not, I&#8217;ve got my laptop or my iPhone with me, and more often than not, the iPhone impresses me with its usefulness and size. Indeed, my relatively new iPhone 4 is the best piece of kit I think I&#8217;ve bought this year. It&#8217;s fast, the resolution is stupifying (I can finally read books on it without feeling eye-strain). Its battery life is great, and it replaces a camera, flip video recorder, sat nav, pad and paper and pen relatively painlessly. There are more dedicated apps for it than for the iPad, and they&#8217;re usually better. So the iPhone continues to impress me, and the iPad continues to fail to impress me. When I&#8217;m sat at home, coffee shop, or office, the Mac reliably does everything it&#8217;s possible to do, and is only slightly bigger than the iPad really.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I think the iPad is a terrible device; far from it. It is an impressive piece of kit, and its screen and speed and battery life are great. I do enjoy the times I&#8217;ve passed it around to show photos, for example. I was impressed that my two-year-old niece was able to make swirlly patterns on it, and she did it without needing any explaining. It&#8217;s great for consuming: for reading Kindle books and magazines and blogs and watching video. It&#8217;s got something fun about it, and did I mention that screen being brilliant?</p>
<p>So, I don&#8217;t understand tablets. I don&#8217;t get the desire to touch the thing you want to work on: your hand blocks what you&#8217;re looking at! It&#8217;s also awkward compared to a laptop which angles so you can see it and work at the same time. The iPad is constantly falling off, and its keyboard only makes sense if it&#8217;s mostly horisontal, making it difficult to see. The screen is so reflective that it&#8217;s useless out of doors, even in relatively sun-free Britain. They don&#8217;t multitask in the same way that a laptop does, and they&#8217;re not as portable as a smartphone.</p>
<p>So, unless a tablet is running a kick-ass operating system, is small enough to be truly portable and has thousands of dedicated applications written for it (hmm, sounds like an iPhone&#8230;), I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m sold.</p>

<p>Following my <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/ipad-new/">post about using the iPad recently</a>, I&#8217;ve spent some time using more of the content-focused apps. As I mentioned before, the iPad has turned out to be a great device for consuming, reading and just experiencing media. This has obvious benefits for video, and many of the examples I&#8217;ve seen have made use of multi-media and show off the screen. But I tend to read a lot. I tend to read news from content publishers (BBC, Guardian, Gizmodo) and blogs.</p>
<p>One of the first apps I downloaded was Stephen Fry&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/id374277542?mt=8">FryPaper</a>&#8221; app. It&#8217;s basically Stephen Fry&#8217;s blog manifested as an iPad app, and it&#8217;s one of the most exciting things I&#8217;ve seen. This isn&#8217;t because it&#8217;s swish, flash, or gimmicky. Indeed, it is none of those things. It simply provides the content from Stephen&#8217;s blog in a format that is very, very easy to read on the iPad. It seems to focus on simple design, and that&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s got a very limited set of features, all of which I&#8217;ve used—like using the sharing feature to tweet or email links to individual articles.</p>
<p>So, why is this so exciting?</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s a glimpse of the future of well-published stories. It&#8217;s a snapshot of a time when anyone can buy/download an app for a single blog, and get all this content beautifully laid out.</p>
<p>So, I contacted Stephen&#8217;s FryPaper person, Andrew Sampson of SamFry about building FryPaper.</p>
<p>Here is that quick interview:</p>
<p><strong><em>Zach</em>: Why make an app for a blog? What does the iPad bring to the table that a browser doesn&#8217;t?</strong></p>
<p><em>Andrew</em>: <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/www.stephenfry.com">Stephenfry.com</a>&#8217;s blog is a very popular website in its own right. We wanted to offer that content in a newspaper format, for free on the iPad. We wanted to show how you could strip back other contend and concentrate on what was popular. Less is more, was our rule. It was a good first stepping stone for our company to develop an iPad App on our own.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zach</em>: What did you have to consider in designing it?</strong></p>
<p><em>Andrew</em>: We considered that the iPad is a new device and that whilst newspapers and magazines are glamouring for it, many would argue that a user interface is yet to be defined. We went for the most elegant and simple user interface we could develop. We also wanted to make sharing it easy. I might add that I don&#8217;t see how magazines and papers will be able to sustain the large multimedia elements of their initial iPad offerings. It&#8217;s brilliant that they did but it cost them a fortune to produce the content, let alone the app itself.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zach</em>: Any major challenges or hurdles?</strong></p>
<p><em>Andrew</em>: Cost. We were very lucky to find a Canadian firm that presented their credentials and production pipeline from the beginning. We&#8217;ve had many false starts on app development in the last year, primarily because of cost. Marco Tabini and his team became SamFry&#8217;s partners for FryPaper.</p>
<p>We were also lucky to secure the sponsorship of G-Technology by Hitachi. This was the first time we&#8217;ve ever had another company believe in what we were doing. They showed extraordinary faith and trust in us, even to the degree of letting us design the sponsorship placements within the app. It only adds up to two ads but boy, it&#8217;s allowed us to fund the FryPaper for iPhone, which is due out in the next few weeks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zach</em>: From your experience, is there any advice you&#8217;d give to someone wanting to build a similar content-focused app?</strong></p>
<p><em>Andrew</em>: Be confident in the depth of your content. Stephen, Nicole, our graphic designer and I, have a strong focus on design. We think content and the user interface synergy is the single most important aspect in delivering electronic content. It harks back to our traditional theatrical beginnings.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zach</em>: Thank you Andrew!</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, I counted myself one among the hoards of silly sods who queued early in the morning for the chance to see, touch and indeed buy the much-hyped iPad. My justification for this lameness is that the next day, I was scheduled to fly out for a week-long conference and wanted to try the new device in that context. Talis, my employer, has purchased a few now, but I was the only fool to queue for one. No doubt this is something the support team continues to find justifiably humorous.</p>
<p>Standing in the line and being offered croissants, coffee and advice by brightly T-shirted and strangely too-good-looking Apple staff, my expectations were mixed. As I’ve tweeted before ever actually seeing an iPad, I’m not entirely convinced by the form: the tablet layout and touch screen. It looks slightly awkward to hold, and even that huge keyboard doesn’t look particularly useful for anything beyond quick notes. A screen that big that you’re supposed to touch pretty well continuously will surely be begrimed very quickly. I kept trying to work out what the iPad would be <em>for</em>. Does it replace the laptop for most things? Does it replace the TV, the book, the bedside lamp? (In fact, the thing it’s most usefully and utterly replaced is the shaving mirror, but more on that below.) The fact that it needs the now hugely-inflated iTunes to sync and run, and the fact that it’s running iPhone OS are both factors I’ve been unhappily anticipating for a few months.</p>
<p>But I was exceedingly interested in trying it out, in seeing the way the designs are different, and the way content feels when it’s not part of a computer. The idea of holding a page in your hands, and flicking through images, text and ideas does appeal enormously. Also, the power behind the device, the clear display and proven track-history of innovation piqued my curiosity to see how clever developers will put them to use.</p>
<p>So, with all these factors swirling around in my mind, and the desire for my not having to take a stack of printed books, papers and PDF files with me overseas, I looked into the Kindle and a few other e-readers. The Kindle is expensive, virtually impossible to justify given the multi-purpose nature of the iPad. Even if it proved to be a poor overall experience, the iPad would at least allow me to do everything the Kindle does, plus check email, twitter, blog and browse the whole web of content for only a little more money. The Kindle’s main advantage in the market, however, is access to far more books and resources than any other. So, with the announcement of the Kindle for iPad app, and my boss’s suggestion I pick up an iPad to test for Talis, I found myself among 50 or so pony-tailed die-hards and chirpy Apple Geniuses waiting for my chance to be kitted out with the most lusted-for piece of kit since the last Apple device.</p>
<p>Below are the notes I sent to the Sysadmin team after two weeks of use.</p>
<p>The iPad has been a very interesting thing to use, with it’s novel form-factor and innovative UI (though it’s like nothing more than a big iPhone…). It’s a brilliant device for consuming information, so long as one is indoors. I’ve been very happy to read whole academic papers and about 1/4 of a novel so far on it, and for that alone, it’s been a useful tool for travelling and research. Also, it’s more interactive than the iPhone for email/twitter and, surprisingly, colloquy [IRC client].</p>
<p>So, for being exceedingly portable and present at conferences, it’s been great. Also, because the battery life is actually up to scratch, you don’t have to join the fray of geeks fighting over the single power strip in an undignified yet necessary battle in the corner of any given keynote presentation.</p>
<p>It’s got some strong shortcomings which have proven annoying, however.</p>
<p>While it’s great for consuming, it’s cumbersome and slow for producing. It’s OK for taking quick notes, and perfect for tweeting/short emails, but I wouldn’t want to write a whole blog post on it. (I got the bluetooth keyboard and WordPress app, which together work a treat, but require you to drag around an external keyboard).</p>
<p>It fails in even the tiniest bit of sunlight. So, on Crete [where I was for a week at the ESWC conference], it made a fantastic shaving mirror.</p>
<p>I think there may be some potential for RSI, too, if one types for any extended period of time on it. I touch-type, meaning that I end up resting my fingers on the screen, printing many ffffffffffffffffff’s and llllllllllllllll’s and needing to tap the backspace again and again.</p>
<p>Finally, as a team device, I’m not sure how useful they’d be. So far, the majority of the benefit this has made has been through personalising it a lot. So, if I wanted to share a quick photo with folk, I need to sync it with my photos. If I wanted to blog, I’d need to sync with flickr or similar to have a ready supply of licensed images to use. Likewise with reading (Dropbox, Kindle and Goodreader) all need to know who I am and what I want to read. Same with video, Keynote etc… Unless Talis made them into extremely corporate-oriented devices (which would suck, methinks) and filled them all with Talis-only designs, images, videos and generic slides, they’re pretty person-specific.</p>
<p>So, after just under two weeks of use, I’d say it’s great for travel (I’m looking forward to having it on the 14hr flight to and from San Francisco in a couple weeks, for example), and it’s great for reading (Kindle App, GoodReader and Dropbox). I could see, with additional apps, it being an interesting device for sharing information to a small group. As another colleague pointed out, as a presenting tool for a large audience, it fails at a few hurdles. Firstly, the Keynote app that is so fantastic to use on OS X is woefully lacking on the iPad. Any presentations imported from the Mac lose fonts and transitions (even if they’re possible to re-create in the iPad itself!), and the presenter’s screen doesn’t display next slide and presenters notes. It lacks all the things that make Keynote so great to use. The VGA tie-in means it’s even more awkward to hold, so you’re left leaning it against the lectern in exactly the place your laptop would have been. The form factor is exceedingly social, however, so showing a bunch of select slides at a table, or having a shared mini-whiteboard could be cool.</p>
<p>It’s made much, much better with the bluetooth keyboard, and I couldn’t imagine using it without the Apple cover (which props it up in a variety of ways, and makes it less slipperyf). Some key apps are: sketchbookpro (for white-boarding), Kindle, Goodreader, Dropbox, Colloquy and the twitterrific twitter client.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see it replacing a laptop at any time soon, and if it weren’t for the vast amount of reading I tend to do, I probably wouldn’t feel particularly comfortable with Talis buying this one for my sole use. As it is, I’m happy to use this one for the trip over to the States, and it is growing on me the more I use it for reading and consuming information on.</p>
<p>I hope, as has been said, that version 2 will be more useful, and that OS4 will be a lot more useful even before then.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>The iPad is something I'm more curious about than lustful for. I want to see how it works, how it feels to use and what difference it'll make to the way I do things.</p>
<p>I'll be interested to see how it does at conferences, for example. Whether the format of a tablet is a useful thing to have due to weight and room. </p>
<p>Also, I want to see how media is rendered and if it really does change anything about the way I interact with content.</p>
<p>So, not hugely badly, but I'll be happy to try it out. I imagine it might grow on  me though.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The iPad is something I&#8217;m more curious about than lustful for. I want to see how it works, how it feels to use and what difference it&#8217;ll make to the way I do things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be interested to see how it does at conferences, for example. Whether the format of a tablet is a useful thing to have due to weight and room. </p>
<p>Also, I want to see how media is rendered and if it really does change anything about the way I interact with content.</p>
<p>So, not hugely badly, but I&#8217;ll be happy to try it out. I imagine it might grow on  me though.</p>
