				<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm not entirely sure I understand the question. It's pretty broad. </p>
<p>I think the US has things that make it what it is, some of them good, many poor; but a direct one-for-one swap would not—from my perspective—necessarily bring the benefits they might have in the US. There is, for example, a culture of respect for teachers in the US which I would have liked to have experienced here. Students, still, feel the need to listen to and obey teachers.</p>
<p>However, the things about the society which make this possible are myriad, confusing and far from straightforward. A general respect for authority does, seemingly, exist to a greater extent in the US. But the respect can also manifest as fear, as of police. I instinctively felt fearful around police officers in my home town, probably because I was stopped many times as a teenager for no offense. This has not happened since I moved to the UK, and the culture here seems to be one of the police (generally) respecting citizens.</p>
<p>This, however manifests itself in a state which imposes itself in different, less obvious ways, and a culture in education of active disrespect from students of teachers.</p>
<p>These are gross generalisations, but I think my most basic answer is that the differences are complex, and a simple move from one to the other couldn't work.</p>
<p>Oh, except coffee... there is generally better coffee available in the US. Though, US influence has given some roasters here a good foundation for great beans too.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm not sure how to frame a response to this one...</p>
<p>I've lived in the UK for all but a few months of my voting-eligible life, and this is not the first general election I've been present for. I remember watching the Swing-o-meter and wrapping my head around marginal constituencies, door-to-door canvassing, and the implied outcome of an apathetic society turning out to be a surprisingly well-informed populous. So I'm not sure how foreign I feel, really.</p>
<p>I'd like to think I think of this election as anyone with an education and interest in the future would.</p>
<p>But what DO I think of this election? </p>
<p>I think that the parties are too strong. I watched my first Parliamentary reading a couple weeks ago, as the Digital Economy Bill became the Digital Economy Act through a process of washup and rush toward as this government hurridly tied off it's loose ends. It was the first time I delved into the Whip system, and surprised myself by how incredibly simple it is: vote the way the party agreed, or your club membership will be revoked (along with your parking permit and gym membership, I like to imagine.) I was appalled that the Members of Parliament, elected to represent the best interests of their constituents, were simply corralled to put up their hands at the right minute, then sauntered off again to continue canvassing. I knew this kind of behaviour existed (I've seen Yes, Minister), but I wasn't aware just how BAD and SHABBY the whole process appears. </p>
<p>There are three clubs, all fighting a terrifyingly expensive popularity contest: all struggling to appear the most like someone You and I might want to be friends with. None seems to realise, of course, that You and Me are different, have widely divergent lives, tastes and perspectives; and that none has a chance in hell of appealing completely to both You and Me, so they split the vast differences by trying to appear as least like someone both of us might hate. The result being very little substantial discusion of policy and potential consequences of slightly-different political machines, with the focus going instead to well-rehearsed catchphrases. </p>
<p>Individual MP's are discouraged from standing out, and indeed, probably don't want to for fear of coming under intense pressure from their Whip, the tabloid press or Jeremy Paxman. This is illustrated by the fact that my local MP, a Mr. Phillip Dunne (Conservative), replied to my concerned letter with one which was identical to one sent out to a friend from a different constituency. Indeed, his letter expressing his concern and the evils of a future Labour government was a replica—verbatum—of one sent to many others across the country. Writing to your MP is like asking for a copy of a printed policy list. </p>
<p>None of the parties seems to exist in the present world. It doesn't seem to have occurred to them that someone might, for example, Google a few lines from their heartfelt letter to find thousands of results showing the same words coming back to them; because the Labour MP's did exactly the same thing. It's all a reflection of committees to which we're not invited.</p>
<p>The parties seem to be driven by a somewhat shadowy aristocracy, and the well-connected and powerful of the world are as present here as they are in other "democracies": Murdoch, Mandelson, and other kingmakers. But I think the real problem is that we're all asked to choose between three closed-door groups. </p>
<p>We could perhaps make a difference to the future of the country by joining one of these groups, I suppose. I guess if enough "normal" people were to be well-enough qualified to raise informed objections, and listen to the other sides of problems; we might, slowly etch our own individual influence into the fabric of our particular club. But we won't, mostly. Because we're already occupied with the choices we've made, and we don't feel particularly drawn to a life of defending our view under ever-increasing scrutiny. The clubs attract the clubby, so we shouldn't be surprised that most politicians appear similar. They're a self-selected population of like-minded or like-skilled individuals, and the outcome is a similar-seeming facade.</p>
<p>That sounds extremely cynical, like it doesn't matter what we do. I don't believe that's true, but I do believe that the system's various checks, balances and inertias prevent us from impacting it very heavily.</p>
<p>Maybe this heavy machinery is a good thing. Maybe they stop radicalisation and the "balance" may be some sort of stabiliser? </p>
<p>So, I'm not sure WHAT to think about this election. Judging from the conversations I've had with colleagues and friends, and from the perspectives on programmes, I'm guessing that's not a particularly foreign state of mind, either.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>I don't see history as linearly-progressive. I believe we learn much from our past, and value history. Our story is an accumulation of our thoughts, our lives and our predecessors' ways of living: and it contains many, many truths. We don't always learn from the past, and often forget what used to be known. There have been many darker periods in our stories when we acted foolishly despite the "progress" of generations. So, I do not see any thought as "outmoded," especially in the context of its time. That's not to say I don't think some things should change (we SHOULD learn from our past), and so learn to treat women as equals—a lesson we still have not learned—to be careful with our resources, and to test practices to see which ring true (i.e. homeopathic remedies).</p>
<p>Nor do I see the Enlightenment period as anything that was a total disregard of religious thought. I am not an expert, and most of my historical interest lies further back (I love reading/learning about Anglo-Saxon England, for example), so I'm probably not very well qualified to answer your question. But that period is full of beautiful writing and interesting ways of thinking (such as existentialism). Some even embraced traditional stories and truths (Søren Kierkegaard, for example). So, different ways of thinking took a precedent over past, but no total divorce occurred.</p>
<p>I have a difficult time with the tone of this question, I must confess. It feels superior, as if we (or he/she for having asked it) is so much better than our predecessors. We've conquered religion! We don't need to "cling to outmoded ways".</p>
<p>It sounds hubristic. </p>
<p>We live in a world where we are slowly destroying our own climate through greed and disregard. We, in the past 100 years, have amassed more than enough destructive power to obliterate the surface of our planet. We fight open-ended wars with remote-controlled devices and fill our minds with thoughts of fear, and death, and destruction. We are less egalitarian than many civilisations from our past: looking back at the Saxons, who—even owning slaves—seem somehow less politically crippled than we seem to be now. We watch gladiatorial displays in which losers are humiliated and scorned and winners enthroned, for a short time, in our media and consciousnesses. We grow enough food to feed the planet and more, yet people starve, and the difference between the world's richest and poorest seems bigger than at any time in our story. And, for the first time in decades, we are leaving our children with fewer years to live than ourselves.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I don't see this current reality as superior to all that's past, and I don't rush to disregard something because it is not currently fashionable.</p>
<p>I hope that we do learn, and that we learn to dismantle the structures of religion which allow terrible things to happen behind sacredly-closed doors. And I hope power people wield through controlling thoughts and feelings as with religious dogma lessens.</p>
<p>But I do cling to many ways of thinking. I don't think the world would be better without faith. Without the embodiment of Love, nor the teachings of selfless giving I learned as a kid.</p>

<p>My reasons to write are several, and I will devote some more time to explain these later, but wanted to post my MP&#8217;s response verbatim (my address removed only.)</p>
<p>###<br />
Philip Dunne, MP Ludlow</p>
<p>23rd March 2010</p>
<p>Dear Zach,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email of March 17th regarding extreme internet laws.</p>
<p>For nearly twelve years, the Government has neglected this crucial area of our economy. We believe a huge amount needs to be done to give the UK a modern regulatory environment for the digital and creative industries. Whilst we welcome aspects of the bill there are other areas of great concern to us.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that Britain has the most favourable intellectual framework in the world for innovators, digital content creators and high tech businesses. We recognise the need to tackle digital piracy and make it possible for people to buy and sell digital intellectual property online. However, it is vital that any anti-piracy measures promote new business models rather than holding innovation back. THis must not be about propping up existing business models but creating an environment that allows new ones to develop. That is why we were opposed to original clause 17 and are still opposed to clause 29 which props up ITV regional news with BBC License Fee payers money.</p>
<p>The Government&#8217;s failure to introduce the Bill until the eleventh hour of this Parliament has given rise to considerable concern that we no longer have the time to scrutinise the many controversial and detailed measures outlined in their proposals. We fully appreciate these concerns. However in certain areas, including measures to allow website blocking in certain carefully proscribed circumstances, there has been substantial debate in the House of Lords. I also believe they should be debated in the House of Commons before we agree to them. Only if we are confident that they have been given scrutiny that they deserve will we support them.</p>
<p>IT is also worth pointing out that many of the fears about the Bill&#8217;s proposals are not entirely accurate. People won&#8217;t be discunnected from the internet without due process. And it will only be a small minority of people who consistently infringe copyright who are disconnected, not the average person who happens to have done so once or twice. Even then, they may be able to reconnect using another ISP immediately and without penalty.</p>
<p>Please rest assured that my colleagues in the Shadow Culture, Media and Sport and Shadow Business, Innovation and Skills teams will do everything in their power to work towards legislation that strengthens our digital sector and provides the security that our businesses and consumers so desperately need.</p>
<p>Thank you again for taking the time to get in touch.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Philip Dunne<br />
MP for Ludlow</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>|This article first appeared in Nodalities Magazine, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2">CC By + SA</a></strong></p>
<p>For anyone following the Nodalities blog, you may have read some of my recent posts discussing the trends boiling up around Web 3.0 (other buzzwords are available). The Mobile Web and upgraded connectivity in general; the rise of ubiquitous computing from chips in every product imaginable; Linked Data and the “Semantic Web” as an organising platform for this rising tide of data—these are three very broad trends seeing a lot of media attention presently. From where I’m standing, I tend to see the next great turning point of the Web as a convergence of some of these trends, and see it as a rise in the importance of and reliance upon data itself and data tools generally.</p>
<p>The mobile web is bringing new sorts of information to people, and they can make use of this info wherever they happen to be because of advances in devices ad connectivity. As phones and web-enabled devices get better, so to do the chips we seem to have embedded all over the place, and we can now begin to have a more clear picture of what we do through the information we gather from our heaters, cars, and pedometers. Also, as more objects become connected, the grunt-work of number-crunching and storage is becoming commoditised into big, efficient, utility-like cloud services, which host and work with our collected information much more effectively than the gadget in your hand could ever hope to do. Others, like us here at Talis, talk about the Semantic Web, which allows for an evolution from a bunch of connected documents to the explicit connections between bits of information.</p>
<p>Also fermenting in this mix is a strengthening trend of political transparency and a public, shared ownership of social data. Barack Obama’s new administration has clearly made this a priority with the launch and work around data.gov; and in the UK, Sir Tim Berners-Lee himself has been appointed to an Parliamentary advisory role. There is growing pressure to be able to have access to public data, and to see it as belonging to the nation’s people rather than allowed to be legitimately filed away in the great, locked bureau of the capitols.</p>
<p>So, picking up two fairly obvious trends here: Social, Public Data and Linked Data; it would seem to follow that people would begin to have access to previously unavailable information in usable, linked forms. And it’s certainly beginning, as articles elsewhere in this magazine have illustrated. But, what about other chunks of public data? What about when data comes from universities, institutions, scientific foundations and NGO’s? What about charities monitoring crime, CO2 emissions and family histories? Wouldn’t these make a useful piece in the web of social data? What resources have the governments themselves got, if they want to make their public-owned data available in a useful format?</p>
<p>These questions form a major part of the thinking behind Talis’ Connected Commons initiative (talis.com/cc). Basically, Talis has made its Semantic Web platform (including data hosting and access tools) available free of charge for any datasets made available to the public. In doing so, we’re hoping to remove the barrier of cost entirely to publishing interesting data in a Linked Data way. One major reason for this is to promote reuse and mashups of this interesting data, and for people to be able to “follow their noses” to the data that completes their projects. But, from a publishers’ perspective, this is important, because it’s removing a major reason not to bother with making data useful, if not only public. So, with this, data can be made public and useable and the developers and users get the benefit of public SPARQL endpoints and API access to interesting data.</p>
<p>To keep the data open and public, datasets need to make use of either the Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) or Creative Commons’ CC0 license. Ian Davis, in his article in this magazine, explains more about waivers and the Connected Commons, and there is a lot more about this particular initiative over on the Talis site (talis.com/platform/cc/faqs/).</p>
<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Sir Tim said: “This is our data. This is our taxpayers’ money which has created this data, so I would like to be able to see it, please.” I wonder if initiatives such as Connected Commons will begin to remove excuses, hindrances, and obstacles? As public awareness of the importance of access gets hotter, this might become a political issue, as well as a pragmatic one. I hope that in the rush to publish data, and in the ensuing discussion and debate that follows, that the users, hackers and developers don’t get sidelined. I think the world is ready for its data back.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/twitter_banned_from_white_house.php">read</a> yesterday that twitter has been banned from the White House. In the post, Marshall Kirkpatrick joked that this could be a reason we haven&#8217;t seen much from Obama&#8217;s twitter stream recently. I must admit however, my initial reaction was sympathetic with the White House for pragmatic reasons, though the attitude of the Press Secretary&#8217;s attitude towards &#8220;twitterers&#8221; did raise the hackles. It makes sense to be secure in the White House, to make sure people aren&#8217;t saying things which could be dangerous or cause scandal through carelessness. &#8220;Loose lips sink ships&#8221;, don&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>But I think there is a wider idea here, which I think I&#8217;ve glimpsed between the lines.</p>

I use it to pass on little observations, like you might to a room full of mates, when there isn&#8217;t anyone there to share with directly. News of Michael Jackson&#8217;s death reached me via an off-colour joke on twitter. These are uses for a technology which it would be difficult to commend.</p>
<p>However, I also use twitter to share news. When my grandfather recently passed away, I received dozens of messages of encouragement and sympathy. Several of us here in Shropshire organise a monthly get together to network and discuss tech-trends and the work we do through the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/shropgeek">@shropgeek</a>. Important announcements at work, and shared interest groups often rely on twitter for their spread and response, and I&#8217;ve had customer service reps from big companies personally respond to my feedback. Of far more significance, the government of Iran was unable to stop twitter, allowing its citizens to tell the rest of the world what was going on when all other forms of communication were censored, blocked, or monitored. And citizens from around the rest of the world responded.</p>
<p>twitter is a medium, and suggesting someone is petty and fatuous because they use it is like suggesting everyone on TV is unimportant or vain. There is no connection between the inane talk-show host and the investigative journalist or head of state! The point is in the message, not the vehicle. But, the point this raises in my mind is that twitter, and other forms of web-enabled channels make for a high level of transparency, and I don&#8217;t think the US (in particular) is a power who likes transparency at the moment.</p>
<p>This has lead me to question what I think of the use of web-media by politicians and important figures, particularly in the US and UK. It makes me wonder whether the &#8220;Loose lips&#8221; philosophy is misguided in the modern world. You see, closing channels, blocking communication, and monitoring messages suggests a democracy that doesn&#8217;t trust its citizens with the truth. Sure, there are controls and securities which must be in place, and I&#8217;m not suggesting for a moment that every clerk should have a constitutional right to twitter state-secrets&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;or am I?</p>
<p>You see, the United States is global super-power on par with, and probably only directly comparable with great states of the past called Empires. The notion of an emperor of the US would chill the blood of most of my family, and thinking of the US as anything but a &#8220;democracy&#8221; is practically heresy. After all, citizens&#8217; rights are ensconced in the very foundation myth and history of the US itself. &#8220;We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal&#8230;&#8221; begins a letter to a despotic monarch, sparking off the touch-pad for liberating men from the rule of figureheads, class and social bondage. But part of this very myth* that the Republic, &#8220;of the people, by the people and for the people&#8221; should be based on citizenship trusted to look after themselves and even take up arms to defend their status as such citizens. There is a deep-running notion in the American psyche that if the government were ever to get too big for it&#8217;s boots, it is the right—nay, duty—of her citizens to act to reduce her power.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t believe the US is a state that can be corrected by its citizens very effectively at all.  I think of the complexity, size, presence and byzantine nature of the US Government, and I feel disconnected, small, and powerless to change anything. Over the past decade, in the name of security, Americans put up with reductions in liberty, and I think this principle is bleeding through the cracks in the facade of governance. Blocking channels is saying: &#8220;we don&#8217;t trust you&#8221;.</p>
<p>What would a country look like where the public had access to the vast majority of government information? Where government officially made use of the media its citizens used? Where government officials were held accountable via the various media whenever they were caught being mis-represented?</p>
<p>Oddly, I think it&#8217;s the UK.</p>
<p>The &#8220;traditional&#8221; media here are a powerful force. It is seen as a near human right to have intimate news of public officials and dealings, and watching politicians being interviewed by members of the press is like eaves-dropping on a job interview or witnessing a cautious father&#8217;s first meeting of a prospective suitor for his only daughter. The press is a force to be reckoned with here, and it&#8217;s not seen as the trustworthy force itself, but is is composed of citizens, not officials.</p>
<p>Does this scandalise the government? Yes&#8230; and no. There is a very different attitude toward elected officials here, which doesn&#8217;t translate easily to American. A Member of Parliament is legally referred to as &#8220;Honourable Member&#8221;, but the &#8220;honourable&#8221; is not taken as read by the average Brit. For decades, for example, Members of Parliament have enjoyed a system of expenses whereby they can claim for nearly every cost of living: from second homes to food and utilities. The true level of this feeding-trough has recently been blown wide by the press (who subsequently have been enjoying their own self-congratulatory feast, but that is another post.)</p>
<p>But, I think the UK get the web, probably because it&#8217;s used to dealing with powerful media. I follow Number 10 Downing Street (the metonymic residence of the Prime Minister) on twitter. No 10 doesn&#8217;t say much, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to expose any state secrets, but I like the fact that it&#8217;s there to be engaged. The Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) hosts an important blog which outlines the government&#8217;s plans to expose public data for normal, every-day citizens to have a play with and to see what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>And, in the last few weeks, the Prime Minister himself has turned himself around almost 180º in my personal opinion. He represents a party for whom I have less time than either of the other major contenders, and I&#8217;ve rather lazily accepted him as an incompetent oaf. But, he&#8217;s finally earned my pint and invite to dinner, if not my vote (if any of his secretaries are reading this, just tweet your acceptance, and I&#8217;ll find some pheasants and Pinotage). A few weeks ago, he appointed Sir Tim Berners-Lee to a Parliamentary advisory role with the explicit intention of opening up and pushing public data online. This is a <strong>major</strong> point, because it leads to transparency through public accountability. There seems to be a movement for Parliament to see public data as belonging to the people who bought it with their taxes, and this seems to be the most democratic way to see it. His recent <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/gordon_brown.html">TED talk</a> also made me think he&#8217;s got a lot more to say than he perhaps has to date; though I think many of his points raise more questions than they answer.</p>
<p>Much has been said in the online world about the new American administration&#8217;s use of social media and the web to mobilise supporters during the election. But there hasn&#8217;t been much since. President Obama launched <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/www.data.gov">data.gov</a>, but there is very little data there. I think the web is seen as a tool for messages, as a part of a bigger campaign, and as a security breach. It&#8217;s something to be used with your own agenda, and only under one&#8217;s own strict parameters. And, perhaps most non-democratically, it&#8217;s been used to broadcast and to cajole—It has not been used to engage. The fact that social media have barely been touched since the election could point to a wider attitude that citizens only matter for the brief time they&#8217;re required to vote.</p>
<p>The UK has already exposed much of its public data, and it&#8217;s planning to publish more and more as Linked Data (machine-readable, immediately useful resources), and it&#8217;s made plans to be more open, grasping the web and the transparency it&#8217;s brought through the hard lessons that spin is impossible with a well-informed citizenry, and on the Open Web, there is less room for your own message than there is for humanity.</p>
<p>*<em>mythos is greek for &#8220;story&#8221;, and it is from that perspective I use the word <em>myth</em>: that it conveys the notion of a commonly-held understanding, not that it is entirely fantastic or without truth.</em></p>

<p>At lunch time today, I learned from a tweet that UK Home Secretary, the Right Honorable Jacqui Smith will resign as soon as convenient to the Prime Minister. Most sources seem to cite the now cliched &#8220;expenses scandal&#8221; as the main reason, but also mention various moments of Home Secretarial <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/article6001447.ece">chagrin</a>.</p>
<p>My initial reaction was one of elation. &#8220;Finally, and not too soon!&#8221; is a sentence too easily thought about someone I think has done more to damage the UK than any one holding power in the last decade.</p>
<p>But this is not how I want her to be remembered. I do not want her to have gone because of a media-fueled feeding frenzy of shame for her <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/jacqui-smith-television-expenses">expenses</a> or her husband&#8217;s use of public funding to watch porn.</p>
<p>Maybe I should clarify?</p>
<p>Last February, I wrote a <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/jacqui-smiths-new-immigration-measures-are-a-pointless-gesture/">piece about the Home Secretary</a> which still attracts concerned comments. It told my story of how her tough stand on immigration affects the legitimate, the law-abiding, and the defenseless rather than dealing with any perceived threat by illegal immigrants, migrant workers, or European nationals.</p>
<p><em>Jaccui Smith should resign because she used a misleading public story to back plans which bring shame and financial hardship to people.</em></p>
<p>One of the most controversial campaigns Ms Smith backed was one to introduce compulsory ID cards to the UK. She <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7712275.stm">claimed that people would willingly sign up to such a scheme</a>, and much talk of fighting terrorism with these bits of plastic ensued. <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Millions-may-resist-database-says-poll.html">This is a lie</a>, really. People don&#8217;t want it—or, at least, the majority of people don&#8217;t seem to want to spend their money on them. Oh, yes. Not only is the scheme <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/And-the-bad-news-ID-cards-cost-2bn-more.html">hugely</a> expensive to the public, but individuals will have to buy them themselves. The card could cost £30, £60 or <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/immigrationpolicy.idcards">£93</a>, depending on which confused source reported the cost [1]. The scheme itself will cost the UK taxpayers around <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/docA_IPS_cost_report%202009_v11_BM.pdf">£5bn with an additional £375mn</a> coming from foreign nationals, who will be the first victims of the programme.</p>
<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/index.asp">The ID cards information</a> produced by the Home Office itself reads, to this linguist at least, shockingly like propaganda. It produces press releases such as <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/press-2009-05-05a.asp">this one</a>, which appear to show an eagerness which belies the fact that nearly every mention I&#8217;ve seen in media regarding the scheme has contained the word &#8220;Controversial&#8221;. It has proven so controversial, indeed, that the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/3127696.stm">latest report</a> I read showed that the Home Office seems to have changed its mind massively. This leads me to believe that the Home Office misleads, both in content and in linguistic implication through its own media.</p>
<p><em>Jacqui Smith should resign because her policy to introduce ID cards is </em><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8037085.stm"><em>not democratically supported</em></a><em>, is questionable and expensive, and her promotion of the scheme is biased and untrue.</em></p>
<p>On any <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/jacqui-smith-key-moments">number</a> of profiles trying to make sense of or <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/jacqui-smith-resignation">summarise</a> Ms. Smith&#8217;s career, another low point has been the proposal to <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7130072.stm">allow imprisonment without charge for 42-days of suspected terrorists</a>. This has proven controversial (simply search for &#8220;Jacqui Smith 42 days&#8221; to see.) and demonstrates Ms Smith&#8217;s disregard for the ancient principle of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Due_process#In_England">due process</a>. The Proposal was mercifully <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7668477.stm">scrapped</a> last year.</p>
<p><em>Jacqui Smith should resign because her principles do not include thousand-year-old fundamentals of basic citizens&#8217; rights.</em></p>
<p>Not everything undertaken by Ms Smith has been terrible. Throughout a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8079374.stm">mixed career</a>, it should be mentioned that she held her ground, proved resiliant, and handled difficulties well (until now). The Right Honourable Jacqui Smith, MP has been the UK&#8217;s first female Home Secretary, and no doubt worked very hard. However, this was expected of an MP, and a Home Secretary should handle her job well, which is why it is news when this has not been the case.</p>
<p>Ms. Smith has been forced out of office following news of the least-damaging scandal. Shame on the media for blowing out of perspective the theft of several thousand pounds in claimed expenses in the light of a proposed spend of £5bn to encumber citizens and ostracize legitimate foreign nationals. Shame on the reporting that claims her husband&#8217;s silly use of £10 to watch porn should take precedent for misleading a nation, trying to create and enforce draconian laws and damaging the reputation of a great democracy.</p>
[1]: It should be noted that the £93 claim is old, and that the Home Office seems to say most recently that the cards will cost £30 for early adopters and rise to £60 after two years.</p>
<p>Additional ID Card Stories include: <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/7736588.stm">Scotland refuses to back them.</a>, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/article587163.ece">and some initial concern about the cost raised by the LSE</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m introducing old friends; but <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> is a &#8220;microbloggiing&#8221; platform, to give it its proper description. it gives users 140 characters to publish status updates, comments, gripes, complaints, praises, news and whatever comes to mind. It&#8217;s burst out of its original answer to the simple question: &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; and users often tweet just about everything.</p>
<p>One interesting innovation is the integration of the hashtag. Simply a hash symbol (#) and a tag descriptor for the comment. This gives people the ability to follow particular threads of updates or participate in conversations around an interest. They&#8217;re often used, for example, to update the goings on from conferences (#FOWA for example). People give their own content this little bit of information, and a search engine can find them. People can add additional information and follow conventions which allow for distributed trends that anyone can follow and interact with.</p>
<p>The recent snowfall in Britain gave rise to a flurry of tweets about road closures, amounts of snow falling, schools closing down and all the other chaos unleashed. When users followed a simple convention, however, this information got organised. People quickly adopted the #uksnow hashtag to track the topic; and eventually someone worked out a way to capture all the info needed to follow these geographically. By tweeting the first half of a UK post code plus a rating out of ten snowfall, anyone following the thread knows exactly where it&#8217;s snowing. It&#8217;s like an instant weather polling station, distributed across the country. It can go a step further, however, when services can actually mashup these tweets when users turn their simple status updates into a mini line of code.</p>
<p>This little bit of information allows for people to write software to track and automate the twitter information. This <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/snow">interactive map</a> from benmarsh.co.uk, for example, actually plots a visual graph of snowfall across Britain. Bigger snowflakes indicate larger numbers out of ten in the poll. It&#8217;s simple, really. Ingenious, possibly. But the fundamental distinction between this tracking ability and the noise of thousands of Twits shouting about the snow is that little bit of metadata.</p>
<p>So, is this use of twitter a metaphor for the Semantic Web? It&#8217;s certainly a picture of automating information flow using metadata via software. Sounds Semanticcy to me.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever had a superficial conversation suddenly run your blood cold?</p>
<p>On the short cab-ride to my hotel following FOWA (more to follow), the cab driver was explaining the extension of the conference venue. This is not usually the preamble to a conversation that changes your perspectives, except maybe on the architectural uses of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/2308811412">steel spider&#8217;s legs and concrete</a>. However, he was saying that the folks that bought Manchester United (<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/L1425234.php">actually, he should have said City</a>), bought the Excel centre for a $1billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently,&#8221; said the cabby, &#8220;they do a lot of, you know, &#8216;God conferences&#8217;, evangelical like, yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221; I enquired—shocked because I&#8217;d been greeted by some charismatics in red teeshirts on my first visit to FOWA, and they&#8217;d been there every morning, greeting folks entering the conference and—strangely—leaving the toilets.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/1380640085_4192fb838b.jpg?resize=206%2C154"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 5px;" title="religion" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/1380640085_4192fb838b.jpg?resize=206%2C154" alt="" width="206" height="154" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>&#8220;Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of money in it over in the States. Folks that run &#8217;em want to come to England, and get some British God-money, I guess. Problem for them is: there aren&#8217;t any places big enough! So, they buy it, and are building a bigger place. Lots of dosh!&#8221;</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I had cynically been thinking to myself that the red-tee-shirted cohort of pentecostals greeting me by name (no, nothing spiritual—we all wear name-tags!) had been selected for their good looks and ethnic diversity. But I thought I was being cynical.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: I overheard maybe ten conversations between geeks (It was a web conference, after all) about the &#8220;religious people/ god-folk/ Christian nutters&#8221;, and my heart sank. One or two said that a cheery greeting first thing in the morning is quite nice. Most, however, thought they were over-bearing, weird, or strangely sexy.</p>
<p>The thing that gets me here, is that the public image of Jesus&#8217; followers is horribly maimed here. Wasn&#8217;t it Jesus who through money-changers out of the temple? Wasn&#8217;t it Jesus who went to societies low-lifes and changed their worlds? You think he would have scored well with a PR agency? Think he had a Marketing team or cheer-leaders?</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing spiritual they [Arab investors in the venue] get is this:&#8221; and the cabby rubbed his fingers in the international symbol of money.</p>
<p>What should I say to this? I&#8217;m lost for words&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have come to the conclusion, after being without a car for five years, that travel by rail in the UK is just about the most infuriating process you can undertake on a regular basis. Every day, one of my 6 train journeys to or from work will fail in some way or other. Either there will be a delay, a last-minute platform change, a cancellation&#8230; something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Looking at the complexity of the rail network, it&#8217;s not surprising that it doesn&#8217;t always run exactly right. However, since I can pretty much guarantee that my train journey to work or back will be compromised in some way, I&#8217;m starting to wonder. There is no &#8216;normal&#8217; service, you see. It&#8217;s a myth that the trains usually make it on time. Perhaps it is more than 50% of each leg of any given journey&#8230; maybe. But at some stage in every multi-sectioned journey I&#8217;ve had, some aspect of the trip fails.</p>
<p>II&#8217;m beginning to wonder what could possibly fix this situation. I&#8217;m told daily by an electronic voice: &#8220;I&#8217;m extremely sorry for the severe delay to this service.&#8221; I wonder what rail executives hope to achieve by creating an automated apology system? It&#8217;s not exactly like it&#8217;s a good value for money trade-off either. Train travel is bloody expensive, and it doesn&#8217;t work the majority of the time.</p>
<p>Maybe executive heads need to roll, maybe a huge infusion of public money needs injecting into the system, maybe&#8230; they need a change of perspective. If they measure every individual step in a day, they might come to the conclusion that they&#8217;ve failed n number of times. n=number of delayed, cancelled or otherwise compromised phases of transit between any two given points on the network. However, if X represents the full journey of an individual in a sampled population, and X is made up of a number of phases, I wonder how many X&#8217;s would end up compromised in some way?</p>
<p>Sample 100 complete journeys across the entire network. Each journey is an individual X (complete from point A to B with each stop and change included). Each completed leg of any given X could be designated y, and any compromised legs (including additionally-accrued attrition from one failed leg compromising another) could be w&#8217;s.</p>
<p>There are two numbers I&#8217;d be interested in seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ratio of y&#8217;s to w&#8217;s across the sampled population&#8217;s collective X&#8217;s</li>
<li>The number of X&#8217;s which contain at least one w</li>
</ul>
<p>I reckon and predict, that these numbers would reflect very unfavorably on the network&#8217;s ability to run itself.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the fix?</p>
<p>No idea&#8230; though I do worry no one in the rail network has any clue either.</p>
