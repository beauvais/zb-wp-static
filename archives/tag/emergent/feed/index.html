								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever had a superficial conversation suddenly run your blood cold?</p>
<p>On the short cab-ride to my hotel following FOWA (more to follow), the cab driver was explaining the extension of the conference venue. This is not usually the preamble to a conversation that changes your perspectives, except maybe on the architectural uses of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/2308811412">steel spider&#8217;s legs and concrete</a>. However, he was saying that the folks that bought Manchester United (<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/L1425234.php">actually, he should have said City</a>), bought the Excel centre for a $1billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently,&#8221; said the cabby, &#8220;they do a lot of, you know, &#8216;God conferences&#8217;, evangelical like, yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221; I enquired—shocked because I&#8217;d been greeted by some charismatics in red teeshirts on my first visit to FOWA, and they&#8217;d been there every morning, greeting folks entering the conference and—strangely—leaving the toilets.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/1380640085_4192fb838b.jpg?resize=206%2C154"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 5px;" title="religion" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/1380640085_4192fb838b.jpg?resize=206%2C154" alt="" width="206" height="154" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>&#8220;Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of money in it over in the States. Folks that run &#8217;em want to come to England, and get some British God-money, I guess. Problem for them is: there aren&#8217;t any places big enough! So, they buy it, and are building a bigger place. Lots of dosh!&#8221;</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I had cynically been thinking to myself that the red-tee-shirted cohort of pentecostals greeting me by name (no, nothing spiritual—we all wear name-tags!) had been selected for their good looks and ethnic diversity. But I thought I was being cynical.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: I overheard maybe ten conversations between geeks (It was a web conference, after all) about the &#8220;religious people/ god-folk/ Christian nutters&#8221;, and my heart sank. One or two said that a cheery greeting first thing in the morning is quite nice. Most, however, thought they were over-bearing, weird, or strangely sexy.</p>
<p>The thing that gets me here, is that the public image of Jesus&#8217; followers is horribly maimed here. Wasn&#8217;t it Jesus who through money-changers out of the temple? Wasn&#8217;t it Jesus who went to societies low-lifes and changed their worlds? You think he would have scored well with a PR agency? Think he had a Marketing team or cheer-leaders?</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing spiritual they [Arab investors in the venue] get is this:&#8221; and the cabby rubbed his fingers in the international symbol of money.</p>
<p>What should I say to this? I&#8217;m lost for words&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Image:Fulton.jpg"></a></p>
<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged">
<div style="width: 153px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Image:Fulton.jpg"><img title="February 11: Fulton patents steamboat." src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/202px-Fulton.jpg?resize=143%2C204" alt="February 11: Fulton patents steamboat." width="143" height="204" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>
</div>
<p>I have begun to see that we may be entering a new age of polymaths, and I&#8217;m happy to be involved in a part of the business world which seems to sustain some of the best brains on the planet.</p>
<p>I remember reading about the beginners of industry—the pioneers of technology and science. I remember reading how <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Robert_Fulton">Robert Fulton</a> came up against problems in life, and simply invented new ways of doing things, leading eventually to the development of steam-powered paddle-wheel-boats. I remember, vaguely, from my propagandistically pro-industrial schooling that as a child, Fulton had invented or improved on the lead pencil, because the one he was using in school wasn&#8217;t up to scratch. The same story is reflected through many of the West&#8217;s inventors of what we&#8217;ve retrospectively come to call <a class="zem_slink" title="Industrial Revolution" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Industrial_Revolution">the Industrial Revolution</a>: when opportunity or difficulty forced their hands, they changed the situation.</p>
<p>Now, aside from natural romanticism, I like to look to the past with neither rose-tinted glasses nor &#8220;isn&#8217;t-everything-better-now&#8221; short-sightedness. I&#8217;m sure that for every changer, there were crowds of followers in every age, and I&#8217;m sure many of you could point easily to both an earth-changer and a follower without too much effort. Besides, history pays scant attention to followers.</p>
<p>No, what I&#8217;m talking about is the seeming ease with which many of my colleagues in the web industry switch between impressively diverse tasks. Some I know make impressive presenters, and happen to hold PhD&#8217;s in fields more or less unrelated to what they do now&#8230; and can code Java and know a bit of <a class="zem_slink" title="Cascading Style Sheets" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> on the side. I fear to challenge any to play chess (since I haven&#8217;t played in over 5 years, and have the patience of a twelve-year-old), and several are rumoured to be better-than-average musicians. This diversified excellence, alongside the startups, ideas, enthusiastic organisations and programmes i&#8217;ve seen recently, remind me of the society-changers of a century and more ago. Not since then, I think, has such an importance been placed on ambition within social responsibilities.</p>
<div class="alignright"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NgSRwOZtDQ8&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/NgSRwOZtDQ8&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
<p>One of the things I&#8217;ve seen most recently has been the Google 10^100 (apparently pronounced: ten to the one-hundredth with a typically geeky need to explain the pun) which aims to &#8220;help as many people as we can&#8221; by contributing $10million to fund earth-changing ideas. Their site is, in classic Google fashion, very straightforward, so I won&#8217;t repeat their blurb&#8230;just go have a read. But, while you are doing it, I dare you to set aside any cynicism you may harbour either toward a big business, or to any notion of &#8220;changing the world&#8221;. Think about what has and is being done, and then think how you could change the world.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/www.kiva.org"></a>It&#8217;s been a few months since I last spoke about Kiva.org, and I wanted to bring it up again. </p>
<p>Since writing, I&#8217;ve tried out the lending scheme, and am blown away with the ability to make a difference to places where it&#8217;s seriously needed. Not only has Kiva created an infrastructure for microlending which makes it incredibly easy to lend small amounts to entrepreneurs in developing countries, but it makes use of the very nature of the Web in connecting you with people all over the world. </p>
<p>The idea of &#8216;sponsorship&#8217; isn&#8217;t really stressed. This isn&#8217;t a: &#8220;For pennies a day, you could clean this water&#8230;&#8221; It&#8217;s much more of a chance to invest directly into the lives of people who need it, and have a chance to pull themselves up. </p>
<p>My primary worry, when lending (giving) is that I&#8217;ll be made to feel like a vouyer in some way. Instead of concern, I worry that I will be made to focus on fascination or curiosity. This doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case with Kiva. Although it doesn&#8217;t feel like a standard business transaction, it does present enough facts in a straight-forward way. There is not over-blown language, but clear presentation of cases.</p>
<p>I also feel more comfortable lending directly to &#8220;partners&#8221; in developing nations. I feel this is much more efficient, and more in the spirit of a digital age. Why would I want to pay the salary of a well-meaning (and not, in any way exploitative) but still Western individual with my giving, when I can invest directly in people already poised to make a difference?</p>
<p>Finally, and possibly most importantly: Kiva doesn&#8217;t take any cut of the loans they provide. Instead, they ask for a separate donation (without any nag or detriment to the service). They don&#8217;t make a big deal of this (rightly), but I feel I should mention it. These people are providing a world-changing service, with few resources, without charging anything for &#8216;upkeep&#8217;. Not only that, but they only ask after you&#8217;ve chosen an amount and a project to support, making it less likely for you to lower your loan amount at that stage to compensate the infrastructure.</p>
<p>To my mind, this is the future of peer-to-peer investment and development. Now, we just need a way to send other resources in a similar infrastructure (education, information, digital resources, experience, and design).</p>
