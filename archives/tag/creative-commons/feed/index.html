Because Facebook has recently made announcements about moving in a Semantic Web direction, I spoke with their Senior Open Programs Manager, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/davidrecordon.com">David Recordon</a>, about Facebook&#8217;s perspectives on many of the technologies they&#8217;re beginning to use. We ended up discussing Social Networking as a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Graph_(mathematics)">graph</a>‚Äîthat is: a network of related things. We also spoke about the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/opengraphprotocol.org">Open Graph Protocol</a> they&#8217;ve worked on and touched on privacy and walled gardens.</p>
<p>As you listen to the podcast, you can have a look at the source code for <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com">my site</a>. (Just don&#8217;t run any validators on it and complain about what a poor developer I am: I already know <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). In the head, you&#8217;ll notice a few lines of metadata that are discussed in the podcast:</p>
<div class="su-note" style="border-color:#e5e0b1;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-clearfix" style="background-color:#fef9c5;border-color:#fffef3;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">&lt;meta property=&#8221;og:title&#8221; content=&#8221;Blogging Perspective&#8221; /&gt; &lt;meta property=&#8221;og:type&#8221; content=&#8221;blog&#8221; /&gt; &lt;meta property=&#8221;og:email&#8221; content=&#8221;contact@zachbeauvais.com&#8221; /&gt; &lt;meta property=&#8221;og:url&#8221; content=&#8221;http://www.zachbeauvais.com&#8221; /&gt; &lt;meta property=&#8221;og:description&#8221; content=&#8221;Zach Beauvais&#8217; home on the web: his perspective, images and ideas.&#8221; /&gt;</div></div>

<p>The <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/opengraphprotocol.org">Open Graph Protocol page</a> has information about the protocol itself. <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/f8">Facebook&#8217;s f8 developers&#8217;</a> conference site also has links with more information for developers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>|This article first appeared in Nodalities Magazine, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2">CC By + SA</a></strong></p>
<p>For anyone following the Nodalities blog, you may have read some of my recent posts discussing the trends boiling up around Web 3.0 (other buzzwords are available). The Mobile Web and upgraded connectivity in general; the rise of ubiquitous computing from chips in every product imaginable; Linked Data and the ‚ÄúSemantic Web‚Äù as an organising platform for this rising tide of data‚Äîthese are three very broad trends seeing a lot of media attention presently. From where I‚Äôm standing, I tend to see the next great turning point of the Web as a convergence of some of these trends, and see it as a rise in the importance of and reliance upon data itself and data tools generally.</p>
<p>The mobile web is bringing new sorts of information to people, and they can make use of this info wherever they happen to be because of advances in devices ad connectivity. As phones and web-enabled devices get better, so to do the chips we seem to have embedded all over the place, and we can now begin to have a more clear picture of what we do through the information we gather from our heaters, cars, and pedometers. Also, as more objects become connected, the grunt-work of number-crunching and storage is becoming commoditised into big, efficient, utility-like cloud services, which host and work with our collected information much more effectively than the gadget in your hand could ever hope to do. Others, like us here at Talis, talk about the Semantic Web, which allows for an evolution from a bunch of connected documents to the explicit connections between bits of information.</p>
<p>Also fermenting in this mix is a strengthening trend of political transparency and a public, shared ownership of social data. Barack Obama‚Äôs new administration has clearly made this a priority with the launch and work around data.gov; and in the UK, Sir Tim Berners-Lee himself has been appointed to an Parliamentary advisory role. There is growing pressure to be able to have access to public data, and to see it as belonging to the nation‚Äôs people rather than allowed to be legitimately filed away in the great, locked bureau of the capitols.</p>
<p>So, picking up two fairly obvious trends here: Social, Public Data and Linked Data; it would seem to follow that people would begin to have access to previously unavailable information in usable, linked forms. And it‚Äôs certainly beginning, as articles elsewhere in this magazine have illustrated. But, what about other chunks of public data? What about when data comes from universities, institutions, scientific foundations and NGO‚Äôs? What about charities monitoring crime, CO2 emissions and family histories? Wouldn‚Äôt these make a useful piece in the web of social data? What resources have the governments themselves got, if they want to make their public-owned data available in a useful format?</p>
<p>These questions form a major part of the thinking behind Talis‚Äô Connected Commons initiative (talis.com/cc). Basically, Talis has made its Semantic Web platform (including data hosting and access tools) available free of charge for any datasets made available to the public. In doing so, we‚Äôre hoping to remove the barrier of cost entirely to publishing interesting data in a Linked Data way. One major reason for this is to promote reuse and mashups of this interesting data, and for people to be able to ‚Äúfollow their noses‚Äù to the data that completes their projects. But, from a publishers‚Äô perspective, this is important, because it‚Äôs removing a major reason not to bother with making data useful, if not only public. So, with this, data can be made public and useable and the developers and users get the benefit of public SPARQL endpoints and API access to interesting data.</p>
<p>To keep the data open and public, datasets need to make use of either the Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) or Creative Commons‚Äô CC0 license. Ian Davis, in his article in this magazine, explains more about waivers and the Connected Commons, and there is a lot more about this particular initiative over on the Talis site (talis.com/platform/cc/faqs/).</p>
<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Sir Tim said: ‚ÄúThis is our data. This is our taxpayers‚Äô money which has created this data, so I would like to be able to see it, please.‚Äù I wonder if initiatives such as Connected Commons will begin to remove excuses, hindrances, and obstacles? As public awareness of the importance of access gets hotter, this might become a political issue, as well as a pragmatic one. I hope that in the rush to publish data, and in the ensuing discussion and debate that follows, that the users, hackers and developers don‚Äôt get sidelined. I think the world is ready for its data back.</p>

I love the interface, the drag/drop, the ajaxed admin area and loads of other features. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s also broken.</p>
<p>My problem occurs when I update plugins. Whenever a WP plugin needs updating, the automated system has failed to reactivate it every single time. Unfortunately, it also removes the plugin entirely, leaving ¬†me without that functionality. This is particularly annoying when it removes tracking codes, so I can&#8217;t see how many folks have been on my site!</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m going to have to reinstall it from scratch. If the theme is jumpy, or something&#8217;s missing, it&#8217;s probably for that reason. Hopefully, it&#8217;ll all be back up and running soon, with plugins working nicely, and all my content secured.</p>
<p>&#8230; hopefully!</p>

Innovation, if you like, occurs at the join between ideas when they connect. I see this as fundamental to the way ideas and their applications (technology) advance. I tend to believe that anything &#8220;novel&#8221; is actually affected when other ideas are connected together.</p>
<p>In the technological world, this seems like a strong analogy for Linked Data: information which can be connected by a web-like network of links. These Linked Data have become the foundation for what has come to be known as the ‚ÄúSemantic Web‚Äù, a web of connected information which breaks out of information silos and enables the discovery of new ideas from old, and innovation from existing information. We use the phrase &#8220;serendipitous reuse&#8221; for the idea that once an idea (or a piece of data) is published, it can be used and reused in novel ways and in context of other data to produce unexpected, and unforeseeable possibilities. These ideas (data, again) become increasingly useful when published in a format which allows them to be linked freely to ANY other piece of information. We&#8217;ve had the distribution method for this network for years (the good, ol WWW itself) and it&#8217;s been about a year since  RDF was launched by the WWW Consortium to handle the data itself. The idea is basically to give every bit of data an address (a universal address, not one subjective to a database like a cell reference), and to predicate that bit of information very much like language does. If you think of it like a language, RDF lets bits of data (nouns) to be acted upon or act upon (verbs) others (other nouns). This triple-format enables a near infinite recombination (theoretically) of any data, anywhere with an address.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the problem? Well, most of the world&#8217;s data are locked away in silos (prisoners of the cells their databases confine them to). Many organisations may wish to make use of their data in a semantic environment, and many might even embrace the Open-source nature of their data, and make it freely available to the world to recombine and use: there are always more innovations outside an organisation than within! In order to lower barriers to enter this linked data world, Talis has built a Platform with resources to host and utilise these connections, making use of semantic web standards (RDF and SPARQL, the query language of the semantic web) and a developer-friendly environment (a RESTFul API, for example).</p>
<p>However, this innovation is only possible when data are accessible. In order to further lower the barriers, Talis is now offering free access to the Platform to host public domain data. We are calling this initiative the Talis Connected Commons, and the offer is not limited to free hosting: the data access services, including access to a public SPARQL endpoint, are also freely available. To keep this data open, you will need to use either the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/1">Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License</a> or the recently launched <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/zero">Creative Commons CC0 license</a> to publish data. Anyone will then be able to freely access the stored data using the Platform services, without API keys and without usage limits.</p>
<p>There is more information available at www.talis.com/cc, where you can find detailed technical information, FAQ‚Äôs and other resources.</p>
