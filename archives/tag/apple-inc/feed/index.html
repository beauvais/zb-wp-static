								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/5288168443"><img class="alignleft" alt="Tablet" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/5288168443_0eb8499505_m.jpg?w=1090" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The more I use it, the more conflicted I am about the iPad. It&#8217;s bright and renders images beautifully. I love the way designers are now taking this big screen into account when they produce apps like <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/products">Pulse</a> news reader and <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/frypaper-an-interview-with-the-man-behind-stephen-frys-ipad-app/">FryPaper</a>. It&#8217;s really fun for showing photos to people.</p>
<p>But—and there are so very many buts—it&#8217;s not brilliant for writing or taking notes. It&#8217;s super fast on slideshows, but takes ages to type, correct, select, copy, and paste. Editing text is still annoying after weeks of practice.</p>
<p>Blogging, as I&#8217;m doing now, keeps reminding me how much easier this would be on my trusty laptop. That image I want to use isn&#8217;t quite right, so I&#8217;ll skip it. What I won&#8217;t do is try to find a good image editor app that actually doesn&#8217;t resize, then find another that does but hides the file somewhere I&#8217;ll never see it deep in the workings of the iPad, I assume. So i won&#8217;t do that&#8230;again.</p>
<p>Dedicated apps can be brilliant, but the ones for services I use aren&#8217;t always. The WordPress app, for example, is terrible. There isn&#8217;t an iPad version of the excellent tumblr app for iPhone at all. So, for most things, it&#8217;s site-based tools missing letters like tumblr and flickr. But these don&#8217;t always render well, and if they need Flash, you&#8217;re obviously stuffed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also just discovered that I can&#8217;t scroll within a frame. This means that I can&#8217;t edit—or even see—the text I&#8217;ve typed here. So I&#8217;ll have to trust that it&#8217;s ok. (It isn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve switched to my laptop, and have corrected a typo and fixed a missing markdown link.)</p>
<p>More often than not, I&#8217;ve got my laptop or my iPhone with me, and more often than not, the iPhone impresses me with its usefulness and size. Indeed, my relatively new iPhone 4 is the best piece of kit I think I&#8217;ve bought this year. It&#8217;s fast, the resolution is stupifying (I can finally read books on it without feeling eye-strain). Its battery life is great, and it replaces a camera, flip video recorder, sat nav, pad and paper and pen relatively painlessly. There are more dedicated apps for it than for the iPad, and they&#8217;re usually better. So the iPhone continues to impress me, and the iPad continues to fail to impress me. When I&#8217;m sat at home, coffee shop, or office, the Mac reliably does everything it&#8217;s possible to do, and is only slightly bigger than the iPad really.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I think the iPad is a terrible device; far from it. It is an impressive piece of kit, and its screen and speed and battery life are great. I do enjoy the times I&#8217;ve passed it around to show photos, for example. I was impressed that my two-year-old niece was able to make swirlly patterns on it, and she did it without needing any explaining. It&#8217;s great for consuming: for reading Kindle books and magazines and blogs and watching video. It&#8217;s got something fun about it, and did I mention that screen being brilliant?</p>
<p>So, I don&#8217;t understand tablets. I don&#8217;t get the desire to touch the thing you want to work on: your hand blocks what you&#8217;re looking at! It&#8217;s also awkward compared to a laptop which angles so you can see it and work at the same time. The iPad is constantly falling off, and its keyboard only makes sense if it&#8217;s mostly horisontal, making it difficult to see. The screen is so reflective that it&#8217;s useless out of doors, even in relatively sun-free Britain. They don&#8217;t multitask in the same way that a laptop does, and they&#8217;re not as portable as a smartphone.</p>
<p>So, unless a tablet is running a kick-ass operating system, is small enough to be truly portable and has thousands of dedicated applications written for it (hmm, sounds like an iPhone&#8230;), I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m sold.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, I counted myself one among the hoards of silly sods who queued early in the morning for the chance to see, touch and indeed buy the much-hyped iPad. My justification for this lameness is that the next day, I was scheduled to fly out for a week-long conference and wanted to try the new device in that context. Talis, my employer, has purchased a few now, but I was the only fool to queue for one. No doubt this is something the support team continues to find justifiably humorous.</p>
<p>Standing in the line and being offered croissants, coffee and advice by brightly T-shirted and strangely too-good-looking Apple staff, my expectations were mixed. As I’ve tweeted before ever actually seeing an iPad, I’m not entirely convinced by the form: the tablet layout and touch screen. It looks slightly awkward to hold, and even that huge keyboard doesn’t look particularly useful for anything beyond quick notes. A screen that big that you’re supposed to touch pretty well continuously will surely be begrimed very quickly. I kept trying to work out what the iPad would be <em>for</em>. Does it replace the laptop for most things? Does it replace the TV, the book, the bedside lamp? (In fact, the thing it’s most usefully and utterly replaced is the shaving mirror, but more on that below.) The fact that it needs the now hugely-inflated iTunes to sync and run, and the fact that it’s running iPhone OS are both factors I’ve been unhappily anticipating for a few months.</p>
<p>But I was exceedingly interested in trying it out, in seeing the way the designs are different, and the way content feels when it’s not part of a computer. The idea of holding a page in your hands, and flicking through images, text and ideas does appeal enormously. Also, the power behind the device, the clear display and proven track-history of innovation piqued my curiosity to see how clever developers will put them to use.</p>
<p>So, with all these factors swirling around in my mind, and the desire for my not having to take a stack of printed books, papers and PDF files with me overseas, I looked into the Kindle and a few other e-readers. The Kindle is expensive, virtually impossible to justify given the multi-purpose nature of the iPad. Even if it proved to be a poor overall experience, the iPad would at least allow me to do everything the Kindle does, plus check email, twitter, blog and browse the whole web of content for only a little more money. The Kindle’s main advantage in the market, however, is access to far more books and resources than any other. So, with the announcement of the Kindle for iPad app, and my boss’s suggestion I pick up an iPad to test for Talis, I found myself among 50 or so pony-tailed die-hards and chirpy Apple Geniuses waiting for my chance to be kitted out with the most lusted-for piece of kit since the last Apple device.</p>
<p>Below are the notes I sent to the Sysadmin team after two weeks of use.</p>
<p>The iPad has been a very interesting thing to use, with it’s novel form-factor and innovative UI (though it’s like nothing more than a big iPhone…). It’s a brilliant device for consuming information, so long as one is indoors. I’ve been very happy to read whole academic papers and about 1/4 of a novel so far on it, and for that alone, it’s been a useful tool for travelling and research. Also, it’s more interactive than the iPhone for email/twitter and, surprisingly, colloquy [IRC client].</p>
<p>So, for being exceedingly portable and present at conferences, it’s been great. Also, because the battery life is actually up to scratch, you don’t have to join the fray of geeks fighting over the single power strip in an undignified yet necessary battle in the corner of any given keynote presentation.</p>
<p>It’s got some strong shortcomings which have proven annoying, however.</p>
<p>While it’s great for consuming, it’s cumbersome and slow for producing. It’s OK for taking quick notes, and perfect for tweeting/short emails, but I wouldn’t want to write a whole blog post on it. (I got the bluetooth keyboard and WordPress app, which together work a treat, but require you to drag around an external keyboard).</p>
<p>It fails in even the tiniest bit of sunlight. So, on Crete [where I was for a week at the ESWC conference], it made a fantastic shaving mirror.</p>
<p>I think there may be some potential for RSI, too, if one types for any extended period of time on it. I touch-type, meaning that I end up resting my fingers on the screen, printing many ffffffffffffffffff’s and llllllllllllllll’s and needing to tap the backspace again and again.</p>
<p>Finally, as a team device, I’m not sure how useful they’d be. So far, the majority of the benefit this has made has been through personalising it a lot. So, if I wanted to share a quick photo with folk, I need to sync it with my photos. If I wanted to blog, I’d need to sync with flickr or similar to have a ready supply of licensed images to use. Likewise with reading (Dropbox, Kindle and Goodreader) all need to know who I am and what I want to read. Same with video, Keynote etc… Unless Talis made them into extremely corporate-oriented devices (which would suck, methinks) and filled them all with Talis-only designs, images, videos and generic slides, they’re pretty person-specific.</p>
<p>So, after just under two weeks of use, I’d say it’s great for travel (I’m looking forward to having it on the 14hr flight to and from San Francisco in a couple weeks, for example), and it’s great for reading (Kindle App, GoodReader and Dropbox). I could see, with additional apps, it being an interesting device for sharing information to a small group. As another colleague pointed out, as a presenting tool for a large audience, it fails at a few hurdles. Firstly, the Keynote app that is so fantastic to use on OS X is woefully lacking on the iPad. Any presentations imported from the Mac lose fonts and transitions (even if they’re possible to re-create in the iPad itself!), and the presenter’s screen doesn’t display next slide and presenters notes. It lacks all the things that make Keynote so great to use. The VGA tie-in means it’s even more awkward to hold, so you’re left leaning it against the lectern in exactly the place your laptop would have been. The form factor is exceedingly social, however, so showing a bunch of select slides at a table, or having a shared mini-whiteboard could be cool.</p>
<p>It’s made much, much better with the bluetooth keyboard, and I couldn’t imagine using it without the Apple cover (which props it up in a variety of ways, and makes it less slipperyf). Some key apps are: sketchbookpro (for white-boarding), Kindle, Goodreader, Dropbox, Colloquy and the twitterrific twitter client.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see it replacing a laptop at any time soon, and if it weren’t for the vast amount of reading I tend to do, I probably wouldn’t feel particularly comfortable with Talis buying this one for my sole use. As it is, I’m happy to use this one for the trip over to the States, and it is growing on me the more I use it for reading and consuming information on.</p>
<p>I hope, as has been said, that version 2 will be more useful, and that OS4 will be a lot more useful even before then.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so I thought I&#8217;d try something. I thought I&#8217;d try writing an entire post on an iPhone. I&#8217;ve downloaded an app&#8230; Think it&#8217;s ingeniously called something like &#8220;blog writer&#8221;. I can tell that my typically long-winded style and use of punctuation will be a killer here! </p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, this feels easy. Whether that&#8217;s the second pint talking, however, would require further experimentation. </p>
<p>I should say: it&#8217;s easy enough to TYPE. Thinking at the same time, I feel, will take some time. So, my devoted reader, you&#8217;re in for a treat of mindlessness&#8230; </p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s as well getting used to using mobile interfaces, I think. With it being this painless to finally BE online through such a small portal leads me to think it&#8217;ll be a limited time before this is the default for simply connecting.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t THAT easy&#8230; It is so very much faster to type. But, this is fine, and it&#8217;ll only get better. However, there are some things which are necessary for this to be my default: </p>
<p>*I need the use of all my fingers. This screen is fantastically good-and I find it very much better as an interface even than my beloved trackball. But the keyboard&#8230; It&#8217;s too slow.</p>
<p>*Faster app switching. This will surely improve with time, but it&#8217;s a bit of a train-of-thought killer.</p>
<p>*Copy/paste. I mean: Come On!</p>
<p>*Finally, the way to navigate among text is to hold one&#8217;s finger somewhere near the text, and drop the resulting cursor somewhere near the letter. Arrows alongside this would be very useful. </p>
<p>So, there you have it: my first iPhone post. Not sure I&#8217;ll rush out to to it again. But it&#8217;s possible. I need more practice with the interface, but I&#8217;m not sure if I will. </p>
<p>One last thought: there&#8217;s limited to no file handling. This is a mistake, I think. I would very much hate to lose this much thumb-written text now&#8230;</p>

Image by <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2319114487" target="_blank">. SantiMB . (too busy)</a> via Flickr</div>
<p>I grew up in a Mac family. My dad used to programme <em>accounts recievable</em> applications on an old, black and white Macintosh, and that was my first encounter with any sort of GUI. Since then, I&#8217;ve used both Mac&#8217;s and PC&#8217;s and have a <a class="zem_slink" title="MacBook" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/MacBook">MacBook</a> for work and a poorly-running, but still brand-new Vista box in my home study. I&#8217;ve even dabbled with Linux several times.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m starting to realise something: an aweful lot of applications (on every platform) get aesthetics completely wrong.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a balance between looking nice, feeling comfortable, and aiding use. I think that the appearance of an application is as important a part of the design as the application itself. It&#8217;s a <em>part </em>of the usability, it&#8217;s not &#8216;eye candy&#8217; slapped on for gratuitous reasons.</p>
<p>This is something Mac&#8217;s understand, and their GUI is gorgeous. Vista&#8217;s pretty good-looking itself, but that&#8217;s it&#8217;s problem: that&#8217;s all it is. The operating system is huge, heavy, slow and unpredictible. It crashes, hangs, and takes minutes to load. I bought a brand new (though admittedly budget-conscious PC) from a manufacturer who shall remain nameless (cough! Dell! cough&#8230;) which barely runs just the <a class="zem_slink" title="Operating system" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Operating_system">OS</a>. I&#8217;ve had to triple the RAM and will be re-installing this weekend.</p>
<p>So, what Can I do about it? I can switch <a class="zem_slink" title="Windows Aero" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Windows_Aero">Aero</a> off&#8230; leaving me with a huge, heavy, unpredictable and slightly-less-slow OS which is now ugly. So there&#8217;s Vista, tipping in the balance with an &#8220;eye candy&#8221; approach at aesthetic design.</p>
<p>I see the visual layout, graphics, and overall presence of an application as part of it&#8217;s feature-set. It should be intuitive to interact with it somehow. I fine OS X much more intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing. Some apps written for it, however, fall far short it it&#8217;s high mark.</p>
<p>ecto is a blogging application for OS X, and it&#8217;s plain. It&#8217;s not minimalist-chic. It&#8217;s not &#8220;sleek&#8221;. It&#8217;s boring and plain. It also isn&#8217;t intuitive, unfortunately. It&#8217;s got loads of features, but it misses its greatest asset: the fact that it&#8217;s built on the most advanced <a class="zem_slink" title="Graphical user interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Graphical_user_interface">Graphic User Interface</a> ever developed.</p>
<p>Strangely, <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/windows-live-services-sucklook-nice-delete-as-appropriate/">I much prefer to blog using Windows Live Writer</a>! Its design works well, it&#8217;s interesting-looking (without being LOUD, like the rest of the intrusive Vista package) and it does what it says it will. It interacts very well with images (unlike ecto!), videos and links. It also has the ingenious feature of dowloading your site&#8217;s CSS so you can actually see how the post <em>should</em> look <em>in situ</em>. (Granted, this doesn&#8217;t always work&#8230;)</p>
<p>The point of this slightly oblique and poorly-thought-out rant, is that the point of software is to make peoples lives better. Designers completely miss that. Window&#8217;s OS designers seem to have thought: &#8220;I know, they want pretty. We&#8217;ll give &#8217;em pretty. It&#8217;ll be so pretty, it&#8217;ll need 3GB RAM and a high-end Graphics Card just to run&#8230; that&#8217;ll show &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s rubbish.</p>
<p>However, whoever was heading the design team for the Live suite (Writer, Mail, Messenger <em>et al</em>), was clearly desinging from an end-user&#8217;s perspective. Their thoughts were probably more along the lines of:</p>
<p>&#8220;hmm, when I blog, I like to be able to do that with images. Wouldn&#8217;t it be good if we could see how it&#8217;d look on the site before we publish? Yeah, Hey! I think people will find this useful&#8230; ooh, that looks good, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear how you get on when designing or using software. Being me, I don&#8217;t think it stops with software design, but is actually a feature of how we live and interact. Let me know&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/#comments">Engadget</a>, I noticed a post about much-rumoured &#8220;Google Phone&#8221;. Apparently, they have it on good authority that the people over at Google are working on their own Mobile OS. The interesting bit, though, is that Google has been working very closely with <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/www.apple.com">Apple </a>on the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/iphone">iPhone</a> project. If they launch their own Google Phone (gPhone, Googlephone, whatever&#8230;) they will be in direct competition.</p>
<p>What I wonder, however, is whether Google and Apple are playing even closer together. Imagine two companies more able to launch intuitive products and acquire companies and methods in order to put them to better use within a larger structure. Google, recently, has been launching its <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/a">Web Office</a> while hoovering up smaller developers to bring in the very best of web-based and hybrid (web/desktop) applications. What does Google need next?</p>
<p><b>Brilliant hardware.</b> Who builds better hardware than Apple?</p>
<p>This is only a guess, but what happens if Google and Apple work closer on mobile tech? Instead of direct competition (which would only result in a proliferation of one-upmanship devices and platforms with little long-term customer satisfaction) a JV of some description could result in the best of breed mobile devices (and why just mobile) with a very long shelf life!</p>
<p>What do you reckon?</p>
