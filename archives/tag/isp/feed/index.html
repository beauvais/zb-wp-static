								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple weeks ago, I wrote to my MP to raise concern for the so-called &#8220;washup&#8221; of last-minute legislation being used to push through the now highly-controversial &#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/digital-economy-bill">Digital Economy Bill</a>.&#8221; </p>
<p>My reasons to write are several, and I will devote some more time to explain these later, but wanted to post my MP&#8217;s response verbatim (my address removed only.)</p>
<p>###<br />
Philip Dunne, MP Ludlow</p>
<p>23rd March 2010</p>
<p>Dear Zach,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email of March 17th regarding extreme internet laws.</p>
<p>For nearly twelve years, the Government has neglected this crucial area of our economy. We believe a huge amount needs to be done to give the UK a modern regulatory environment for the digital and creative industries. Whilst we welcome aspects of the bill there are other areas of great concern to us.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that Britain has the most favourable intellectual framework in the world for innovators, digital content creators and high tech businesses. We recognise the need to tackle digital piracy and make it possible for people to buy and sell digital intellectual property online. However, it is vital that any anti-piracy measures promote new business models rather than holding innovation back. THis must not be about propping up existing business models but creating an environment that allows new ones to develop. That is why we were opposed to original clause 17 and are still opposed to clause 29 which props up ITV regional news with BBC License Fee payers money.</p>
<p>The Government&#8217;s failure to introduce the Bill until the eleventh hour of this Parliament has given rise to considerable concern that we no longer have the time to scrutinise the many controversial and detailed measures outlined in their proposals. We fully appreciate these concerns. However in certain areas, including measures to allow website blocking in certain carefully proscribed circumstances, there has been substantial debate in the House of Lords. I also believe they should be debated in the House of Commons before we agree to them. Only if we are confident that they have been given scrutiny that they deserve will we support them.</p>
<p>IT is also worth pointing out that many of the fears about the Bill&#8217;s proposals are not entirely accurate. People won&#8217;t be discunnected from the internet without due process. And it will only be a small minority of people who consistently infringe copyright who are disconnected, not the average person who happens to have done so once or twice. Even then, they may be able to reconnect using another ISP immediately and without penalty.</p>
<p>Please rest assured that my colleagues in the Shadow Culture, Media and Sport and Shadow Business, Innovation and Skills teams will do everything in their power to work towards legislation that strengthens our digital sector and provides the security that our businesses and consumers so desperately need.</p>
<p>Thank you again for taking the time to get in touch.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Philip Dunne<br />
MP for Ludlow</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you know, I&#8217;ve been emailing my ISP recently to find out why my connection drops every evening to around 500k. Following every email I&#8217;ve sent since January, I have received this automatic response (ISP name removed, for now&#8230;):</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for emailing us.</p>
<p>Our Broadband team have received your email and will get back to you in the next 48 hours. We&#8217;re sorry to say that we&#8217;ve received more emails than normal over the past few days and this is why it might take us a bit longer to reply to your email.</p>
<p>Our call centres are also very busy just now so please don&#8217;t call us for an update on our email reply. Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Thanks for waiting.</p>
<p>In the mean time, why not check out our broadband help pages&#8230;(link)</p></blockquote>
<p>A few notes on why this is unsatisfactory:</p>
<p>Firstly, an automatic apology (&#8220;we&#8217;re sorry to say&#8221;) means nothing; and I would advise any customer services to not include one. It is cut from the same cloth as the oddly cheery recorded announcements broadcast at rail platforms: &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry to announce that the **** service to Manchester has been delayed by 45 minutes. We are <strong>extremely</strong> sorry for this delay.&#8221; It raises the blood pressure with its disingenuousness.</p>
<p>Secondly, to say you&#8217;ve received many extra emails is foolish in the extreme. It puts me in the role of one in a mass of unhappy customers who must all be receiving the same service; and I feel more than ever like shopping elsewhere. Additionally, an automatic response saying &#8220;over the past few days&#8221; for two months is hardly accurate. In fact, it&#8217;s a lie. If it&#8217;s been higher than &#8220;normal&#8221; for that long, it&#8217;s a new normal. Gradually, the meaning becomes something like: &#8220;We receive many, many emails of this nature each dayâ€”far more than we&#8217;re prepared for; and we&#8217;re don&#8217;t see this as a problem. We are happy with the level of service we supply enough not to expand our team. Join the club, and we&#8217;ll get back to you, eventually.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thirdly, the opening paragraph is contradictory. One cannot promise 48-hour turnaround in one sentence, then follow it with a sentence explaining it might take a bit longer. It illicits the thought pattern: &#8220;Longer than what? Longer than 48 hours; then you shouldn&#8217;t say it. Longer than expected; then I will expect less than 48 hours and be disappointed if it is around two days.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>Moreover, this email abruptly cuts off communication channels with the users: &#8220;Our call centres are also very busy just now so please don&#8217;t call us&#8221;. This is a slap in the face, especially for someone experiencing connectivity issues. I cannot stress enough how important it is to be open with customers, even for a large service provider. Perhaps, actually, <em>especially</em> for a large service provider. Telling customers in need of support not to phone is extremely unadvised.</p>
<p>I will not go into the grammar (team is singular, I therefore expect &#8220;Broadband team&#8221; to be predicated by the singular stative verb: has; and why is Broadband capitalised?), for this way lies pedantry (and I don&#8217;t want anyone even more pedantic pointing out all <em>my</em> mistakes!)</p>
<p>This is the first communication your customer receives after a complaint, it should be crafted with care. It&#8217;s not <em>just</em> an automatic reply; it&#8217;s the immediate face of your company. And, as it stands now, it&#8217;s not an attractive face at all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be more than happy to outline suggestions for such an email, and I welcome comments.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Headache by <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/magandafille">magandafille</a>&#8220;</div>
</div>
<p>This evening I sent this letter to my ISP in response to their support followup (I&#8217;ve removed the company name):</p>
<blockquote><p>Please, please don&#8217;t give me a list of troubleshooting tips again&#8230;</p>
<p>The broadband router is attached directly to the test socket, therefore guaranteed by BT.</p>
<p>My microfilter is fine, and I&#8217;ve had different units at various times (of different makes and even colours); and, before you ask, I&#8217;ve got one on every phone line in the house.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve reset the router in the past (though I&#8217;ve been informed that this can actually cause up to 5-days delay, it&#8217;s been more than a fortnight since the last reset).</p>
<p>My speeds are the same.</p>
<p>Nothing changes them.</p>
<p>I have nothing else running when I run speedtests, and have used multiple sites.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve double and more checked all settings on the router itself, and have even switched SSID channels just for grins (no change).</p>
<p>I receive the same speedtest results on different more or less identical systems (OS X 10.5.6 each) though not at the same time, and receive the same result.</p>
<p>My iPhone also grows excessively sluggish between 5pm and bedtime.</p>
<p>My last ISP supplied me with a list of 13 troubleshooting tasks, and I completed them duly before each escalation&#8230; none of them resulted in any increase in speed whatsoever. The only thing I could think to do further is to construct a DIY parabola booster to increase the signal from the router to my Mac, though, since I write this from less than 3 meters from the router, I doubt that would help much either.</p>
<p>The speeds drop at peak times. That means there&#8217;s too much traffic for the infrastructure you supply. I&#8217;ve had no problem with (name of ISP) so far, and am fully aware that the West Midlands is low on its priority list (or, at least, BT&#8217;s list), and have come to terms with the low bandwidth that entails. However, you advertise speeds in my area (and have said in correspondence that you expect speeds in my area) to be at around 3MB/s. This is not true, daily.</p>
<p>Not only have my speeds routinely dipped below 1.5MB, but have even dipped below 500k on several occasions. I&#8217;ve not experienced &#8220;broadband&#8221; of that quality in years.</p>
<p>I appreciate your prompt replies, and hope you find whatever it is that&#8217;s causing this slow-down, though I can save you some trouble. It&#8217;s my neighbours, and their neighboursâ€”all using limited bandwidth which you and other ISP&#8217;s continue to degrade by accepting more customers than you can supply.</p>
<p>Regards,</p></blockquote>

If you don&#8217;t follow, that&#8217;s OK. The point is that my old site was Drupal (a heavy-duty Content Management System, which is fantastic) now it&#8217;s Wordperss (cause it does blogging, and does it well). Well, WordPress has won my geeky heart (it&#8217;s smaller than my cynical heart, and not as strong as my music heart, but probably the most covered here).</p>
<p>They have done one thing in the past month which has really, really impressed me. They&#8217;ve got a plugin which lets you upgrade to the latest version of their software (which you install on your webserver yourself) without any complicated, difficult-to-remember steps. This is why I lost Drupal: upgrading, and it killing itself in the transfer. Now, I have the latest WordPress, and I&#8217;m very impressed.</p>
<p>Its WYSIWYG editor works better, and the media manager is fantastic. As you probably know, I stopped using a local blogging client because ecto is rubbish, and Vista is worse. So I now blog from WordPress itself through Firefox on my Mac. Three things that make me happy: WordPress on Firefox running on a Mac&#8230; ah!</p>
<p>Another thing which is brilliant is the flickr sidebar plugin I have had for ages. I completely forgot to check out its &#8220;<a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/flickr">view more photos</a>&#8221; link. It automatically finds images from the sets I&#8217;ve told it about, and uses them to create a page on my site populated with my flickr stream images!</p>
<p>On a down side, I&#8217;ve just noticed that it&#8217;s impossible to see the bottom of the sidebar if Twitter is down, because I have my tweets (micro-blog messages) being pulled into a widget above it, so if it&#8217;s down, it doesn&#8217;t load the rest of the sidebar. I think that&#8217;s something WordPress should sort out. Oh, well. I&#8217;m just going to switch my images tab over to flickr.</p>
