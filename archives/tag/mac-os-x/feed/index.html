<div style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Headache by <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/magandafille">magandafille</a>&#8220;</div>
</div>
<p>This evening I sent this letter to my ISP in response to their support followup (I&#8217;ve removed the company name):</p>
<blockquote><p>Please, please don&#8217;t give me a list of troubleshooting tips again&#8230;</p>
<p>The broadband router is attached directly to the test socket, therefore guaranteed by BT.</p>
<p>My microfilter is fine, and I&#8217;ve had different units at various times (of different makes and even colours); and, before you ask, I&#8217;ve got one on every phone line in the house.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve reset the router in the past (though I&#8217;ve been informed that this can actually cause up to 5-days delay, it&#8217;s been more than a fortnight since the last reset).</p>
<p>My speeds are the same.</p>
<p>Nothing changes them.</p>
<p>I have nothing else running when I run speedtests, and have used multiple sites.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve double and more checked all settings on the router itself, and have even switched SSID channels just for grins (no change).</p>
<p>I receive the same speedtest results on different more or less identical systems (OS X 10.5.6 each) though not at the same time, and receive the same result.</p>
<p>My iPhone also grows excessively sluggish between 5pm and bedtime.</p>
<p>My last ISP supplied me with a list of 13 troubleshooting tasks, and I completed them duly before each escalation&#8230; none of them resulted in any increase in speed whatsoever. The only thing I could think to do further is to construct a DIY parabola booster to increase the signal from the router to my Mac, though, since I write this from less than 3 meters from the router, I doubt that would help much either.</p>
<p>The speeds drop at peak times. That means there&#8217;s too much traffic for the infrastructure you supply. I&#8217;ve had no problem with (name of ISP) so far, and am fully aware that the West Midlands is low on its priority list (or, at least, BT&#8217;s list), and have come to terms with the low bandwidth that entails. However, you advertise speeds in my area (and have said in correspondence that you expect speeds in my area) to be at around 3MB/s. This is not true, daily.</p>
<p>Not only have my speeds routinely dipped below 1.5MB, but have even dipped below 500k on several occasions. I&#8217;ve not experienced &#8220;broadband&#8221; of that quality in years.</p>
<p>I appreciate your prompt replies, and hope you find whatever it is that&#8217;s causing this slow-down, though I can save you some trouble. It&#8217;s my neighbours, and their neighboursâ€”all using limited bandwidth which you and other ISP&#8217;s continue to degrade by accepting more customers than you can supply.</p>
<p>Regards,</p></blockquote>

Image by <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2319114487" target="_blank">. SantiMB . (too busy)</a> via Flickr</div>
<p>I grew up in a Mac family. My dad used to programme <em>accounts recievable</em> applications on an old, black and white Macintosh, and that was my first encounter with any sort of GUI. Since then, I&#8217;ve used both Mac&#8217;s and PC&#8217;s and have a <a class="zem_slink" title="MacBook" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/MacBook">MacBook</a> for work and a poorly-running, but still brand-new Vista box in my home study. I&#8217;ve even dabbled with Linux several times.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m starting to realise something: an aweful lot of applications (on every platform) get aesthetics completely wrong.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a balance between looking nice, feeling comfortable, and aiding use. I think that the appearance of an application is as important a part of the design as the application itself. It&#8217;s a <em>part </em>of the usability, it&#8217;s not &#8216;eye candy&#8217; slapped on for gratuitous reasons.</p>
<p>This is something Mac&#8217;s understand, and their GUI is gorgeous. Vista&#8217;s pretty good-looking itself, but that&#8217;s it&#8217;s problem: that&#8217;s all it is. The operating system is huge, heavy, slow and unpredictible. It crashes, hangs, and takes minutes to load. I bought a brand new (though admittedly budget-conscious PC) from a manufacturer who shall remain nameless (cough! Dell! cough&#8230;) which barely runs just the <a class="zem_slink" title="Operating system" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Operating_system">OS</a>. I&#8217;ve had to triple the RAM and will be re-installing this weekend.</p>
<p>So, what Can I do about it? I can switch <a class="zem_slink" title="Windows Aero" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Windows_Aero">Aero</a> off&#8230; leaving me with a huge, heavy, unpredictable and slightly-less-slow OS which is now ugly. So there&#8217;s Vista, tipping in the balance with an &#8220;eye candy&#8221; approach at aesthetic design.</p>
<p>I see the visual layout, graphics, and overall presence of an application as part of it&#8217;s feature-set. It should be intuitive to interact with it somehow. I fine OS X much more intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing. Some apps written for it, however, fall far short it it&#8217;s high mark.</p>
<p>ecto is a blogging application for OS X, and it&#8217;s plain. It&#8217;s not minimalist-chic. It&#8217;s not &#8220;sleek&#8221;. It&#8217;s boring and plain. It also isn&#8217;t intuitive, unfortunately. It&#8217;s got loads of features, but it misses its greatest asset: the fact that it&#8217;s built on the most advanced <a class="zem_slink" title="Graphical user interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Graphical_user_interface">Graphic User Interface</a> ever developed.</p>
<p>Strangely, <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/windows-live-services-sucklook-nice-delete-as-appropriate/">I much prefer to blog using Windows Live Writer</a>! Its design works well, it&#8217;s interesting-looking (without being LOUD, like the rest of the intrusive Vista package) and it does what it says it will. It interacts very well with images (unlike ecto!), videos and links. It also has the ingenious feature of dowloading your site&#8217;s CSS so you can actually see how the post <em>should</em> look <em>in situ</em>. (Granted, this doesn&#8217;t always work&#8230;)</p>
<p>The point of this slightly oblique and poorly-thought-out rant, is that the point of software is to make peoples lives better. Designers completely miss that. Window&#8217;s OS designers seem to have thought: &#8220;I know, they want pretty. We&#8217;ll give &#8217;em pretty. It&#8217;ll be so pretty, it&#8217;ll need 3GB RAM and a high-end Graphics Card just to run&#8230; that&#8217;ll show &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s rubbish.</p>
<p>However, whoever was heading the design team for the Live suite (Writer, Mail, Messenger <em>et al</em>), was clearly desinging from an end-user&#8217;s perspective. Their thoughts were probably more along the lines of:</p>
<p>&#8220;hmm, when I blog, I like to be able to do that with images. Wouldn&#8217;t it be good if we could see how it&#8217;d look on the site before we publish? Yeah, Hey! I think people will find this useful&#8230; ooh, that looks good, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear how you get on when designing or using software. Being me, I don&#8217;t think it stops with software design, but is actually a feature of how we live and interact. Let me know&#8230;</p>
