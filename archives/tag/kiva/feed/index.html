								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve blogged about Kiva before, and my impression of them and their work keeps growing. Instead of talking more about how great they are, and how they make a huge difference, I&#8217;d like to simply host a very short documentary-promotion video about them. If you&#8217;d like more information, obviously, you can go to <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/www.kiva.org" target="_blank">http://www.kiva.org</a>. If you&#8217;d like my personal experience, please feel free to tweet me(@zbeauvais) or email me (zach at zachbeauvais.com).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/www.kiva.org"></a>It&#8217;s been a few months since I last spoke about Kiva.org, and I wanted to bring it up again. </p>
<p>Since writing, I&#8217;ve tried out the lending scheme, and am blown away with the ability to make a difference to places where it&#8217;s seriously needed. Not only has Kiva created an infrastructure for microlending which makes it incredibly easy to lend small amounts to entrepreneurs in developing countries, but it makes use of the very nature of the Web in connecting you with people all over the world. </p>
<p>The idea of &#8216;sponsorship&#8217; isn&#8217;t really stressed. This isn&#8217;t a: &#8220;For pennies a day, you could clean this water&#8230;&#8221; It&#8217;s much more of a chance to invest directly into the lives of people who need it, and have a chance to pull themselves up. </p>
<p>My primary worry, when lending (giving) is that I&#8217;ll be made to feel like a vouyer in some way. Instead of concern, I worry that I will be made to focus on fascination or curiosity. This doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case with Kiva. Although it doesn&#8217;t feel like a standard business transaction, it does present enough facts in a straight-forward way. There is not over-blown language, but clear presentation of cases.</p>
<p>I also feel more comfortable lending directly to &#8220;partners&#8221; in developing nations. I feel this is much more efficient, and more in the spirit of a digital age. Why would I want to pay the salary of a well-meaning (and not, in any way exploitative) but still Western individual with my giving, when I can invest directly in people already poised to make a difference?</p>
<p>Finally, and possibly most importantly: Kiva doesn&#8217;t take any cut of the loans they provide. Instead, they ask for a separate donation (without any nag or detriment to the service). They don&#8217;t make a big deal of this (rightly), but I feel I should mention it. These people are providing a world-changing service, with few resources, without charging anything for &#8216;upkeep&#8217;. Not only that, but they only ask after you&#8217;ve chosen an amount and a project to support, making it less likely for you to lower your loan amount at that stage to compensate the infrastructure.</p>
<p>To my mind, this is the future of peer-to-peer investment and development. Now, we just need a way to send other resources in a similar infrastructure (education, information, digital resources, experience, and design).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://kiva.org" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-125" src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/moz-screenshot_fbe9oh.jpg?resize=170%2C90" alt="logo of kiva.org" width="170" height="90" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>When social networking is the topic, I imagine most people think of Facebook, Myspace or LinkedIn—sites fundamentally derived from self promotion and entertainment. Despite the high language used to discuss <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/Social_network_service">social networking</a> and Web 2.0, most of my time spent on them is all about having fun or trying to look better to others (which is what LinkedIn is primarily for). But what about the idea that the world is now connected? Why do I spend most of my time online socialising with people I already know, or participating in interests in which I&#8217;m already interested?</p>
<p>After all, the idea of a network (an online community) is to create and maintain connections between people and groups. It is only a matter of time before connections are made which open eyes.</p>
<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/7012984.stm">Bloggers in Burma</a> have been using the web to broadcast their message not to let the world close its eyes to the disaster there. YouTube has been mentioned to contain many thousands of clips from soldiers in or from Iraq. This is a serious source of information, a broadcast network between communities. And it seems that this call for help could be so easily ignored if it weren&#8217;t for the persistence of the messages: ignorance as a refuge is shrinking daily.</p>
<p>But where&#8217;s the 2.0 in this Web? Where is the sharing and the interaction from these blogs and discussions? Have a look at <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/www.kiva.org">Kiva.org</a>, the most inspiring website I have seen in years. This is a set of actions, and a practical source of actual tools we can use to share.</p>
<p>This is the community beginning.</p>
<p>Spend some time in the About section over at Kiva, and you will see the beginnings of a response to the cries of the poorer bits of our larger community.</p>
<p>I believe the Church&#8217;s response to world poverty needs to be a powerful and practical one. I believe that when it says in Acts that there were no orphans and widows among them, it wasn&#8217;t just about bragging, but was a description! When the teacher tried to catch Jesus out by asking: &#8220;Who is my neighbour?&#8221; he was just the first recorded using the excuse that we just don&#8217;t know. That isn&#8217;t good enough any more, and our Neighbourhood is getting bigger!</p>
