				<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm not entirely sure I understand the question. It's pretty broad. </p>
<p>I think the US has things that make it what it is, some of them good, many poor; but a direct one-for-one swap would not—from my perspective—necessarily bring the benefits they might have in the US. There is, for example, a culture of respect for teachers in the US which I would have liked to have experienced here. Students, still, feel the need to listen to and obey teachers.</p>
<p>However, the things about the society which make this possible are myriad, confusing and far from straightforward. A general respect for authority does, seemingly, exist to a greater extent in the US. But the respect can also manifest as fear, as of police. I instinctively felt fearful around police officers in my home town, probably because I was stopped many times as a teenager for no offense. This has not happened since I moved to the UK, and the culture here seems to be one of the police (generally) respecting citizens.</p>
<p>This, however manifests itself in a state which imposes itself in different, less obvious ways, and a culture in education of active disrespect from students of teachers.</p>
<p>These are gross generalisations, but I think my most basic answer is that the differences are complex, and a simple move from one to the other couldn't work.</p>
<p>Oh, except coffee... there is generally better coffee available in the US. Though, US influence has given some roasters here a good foundation for great beans too.</p>
