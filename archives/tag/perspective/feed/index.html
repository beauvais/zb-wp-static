Gadgets, people, blogs, books, tips, wine—all good things. At least, the web is full of interesting <em>pages</em> about these things. In a single session, you might read a mate&#8217;s blog (maybe about wine), then browse a retail site for a book that that mate recommended and stumble across a brilliant gadget. That&#8217;s five good things in the space of a few minutes. Here they are, in case you missed them: your mate&#8217;s a person (good), and he&#8217;s got a blog (debatable, but there you go). He&#8217;s talking about wine (which is definitely good), and he happens to recommend a book (great). In the process, you stumble across a gadget (brilliant!).</p>
<p>The problem with all that is that you didn&#8217;t instantly recognise all the good things in that very brief narrative sentence. The web is an interconnected bunch of arbitrarily-related pages, like a catalogue of (often good) stuff, without an index. It&#8217;s arbitrary, because the pages only exist when it&#8217;s linked to; and the <em>stuff</em> can be anything from a purchasable item to an innovative idea. This network is mind-numbingly huge and even the most versatile of polymaths can&#8217;t be interested in all of it. So, what we want is all the good stuff, and we want it with all the flexibility an arbitrary system can offer (I like <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/17332-Stormhoek_Pinotage" target="_blank">this</a>, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ref=br_lf_m_1000229463_1_4_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;s=electronics&amp;pf_rd_p=223234991&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_i=1000229463&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_r=1K4Z2YBQWEFRY8RBEVEH" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Sigur+R%C3%B3s" target="_blank">this</a>&#8230; are they related in any way?)</p>
<p>Well, when <em>I</em> look at them, I can see that they&#8217;re related; and not just because I happen to have chosen three things I like. I have had the tremendous privilege of testing a gadget which lets me capture these things, and lets me peek at how they connect with my own little perspective on the web. The gadget&#8217;s called <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/getglue.com">Glue</a>, and it&#8217;s the latest offering from <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/www.adaptiveblue.com">AdaptiveBlue</a>. I&#8217;ve blogged about AdaptiveBlue&#8217;s Smartlinks in the past, and they&#8217;re responsible for the little icons next to the linked things above (if you have a decent browser). What they&#8217;ve been doing is allowing you to contextualise the stuff on the web, and Glue goes a step further by letting you also interact with other folks&#8217; contexts.</p>
<p><a class="lightview" href="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/glue_xw4i5u.png"><img data-attachment-id="189" data-permalink="https://beggingaquestion.com/archives/glue-sticks-stuff-together/glue/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/glue_xw4i5u.png?fit=61%2C21&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="61,21" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="glue" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/glue_xw4i5u.png?fit=61%2C21&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/glue_xw4i5u.png?fit=61%2C21&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-189" style="margin: 5px;" title="glue" src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/glue_xw4i5u.png?resize=61%2C21" alt="" width="61" height="21" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Firstly, Glue is a browser plugin for <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/firefox">Firefox</a> (remember, I said to get a decent browser?). Glue creates a  bookmark in your bar, but the real magic occurs when you navigate to some <em>stuff</em>. As you seek out or stumble across interesting things online, the Glue menu glides down, giving you instant options to &#8220;like&#8221; the item, find out more about it, and see who else has &#8220;liked&#8221; it too. They have an excellent walk-through on their site, so I won&#8217;t duplicate their efforts by explaining how it works here, but it does recognise many kinds of &#8220;stuff&#8221; from a myriad of very important sites. <img data-attachment-id="193" data-permalink="https://beggingaquestion.com/archives/glue-sticks-stuff-together/sigur-ros/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sigur-ros_eyml00.png?fit=450%2C492&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="450,492" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="sigur-ros" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sigur-ros_eyml00.png?fit=274%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sigur-ros_eyml00.png?fit=450%2C492&amp;ssl=1" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-193" style="margin: 5px;" title="sigur-ros" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sigur-ros_eyml00-274x300.png?resize=274%2C300" alt="" width="274" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sigur-ros_eyml00.png?resize=274%2C300&amp;ssl=1 274w, https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sigur-ros_eyml00.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1 450w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The interesting part, for me, is that it brings a context to all the arbitrary links we follow all the time. We can see where we fit in with this, and what our mates think too. Best of all, these things are treated just like that: as the things in which we&#8217;re interested. I want to talk about <em>this</em> book, not this page about the book. I want to rate this book, and if a friend sees it on another site, he&#8217;ll still see that I liked it!</p>
<p>Best of all, it&#8217;s a social network without the need for a social-networking space. It&#8217;s the first thing I&#8217;ve seen which successfully breaks out of the need to be inside a specific place in order to interact and contextualise—we don&#8217;t need MyFace&#8217;s training wheels! Glue shifts its focus from trying to hem in, or reduce the web, to elegantly augmenting it.</p>
<p>As you can tell, I really like this gadget, and I thank @fraser and @alexiskold for building it, and letting me have a play of the Beta.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever had a superficial conversation suddenly run your blood cold?</p>
<p>On the short cab-ride to my hotel following FOWA (more to follow), the cab driver was explaining the extension of the conference venue. This is not usually the preamble to a conversation that changes your perspectives, except maybe on the architectural uses of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/2308811412">steel spider&#8217;s legs and concrete</a>. However, he was saying that the folks that bought Manchester United (<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/L1425234.php">actually, he should have said City</a>), bought the Excel centre for a $1billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently,&#8221; said the cabby, &#8220;they do a lot of, you know, &#8216;God conferences&#8217;, evangelical like, yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221; I enquired—shocked because I&#8217;d been greeted by some charismatics in red teeshirts on my first visit to FOWA, and they&#8217;d been there every morning, greeting folks entering the conference and—strangely—leaving the toilets.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/1380640085_4192fb838b.jpg?resize=206%2C154"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 5px;" title="religion" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/1380640085_4192fb838b.jpg?resize=206%2C154" alt="" width="206" height="154" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>&#8220;Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of money in it over in the States. Folks that run &#8217;em want to come to England, and get some British God-money, I guess. Problem for them is: there aren&#8217;t any places big enough! So, they buy it, and are building a bigger place. Lots of dosh!&#8221;</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I had cynically been thinking to myself that the red-tee-shirted cohort of pentecostals greeting me by name (no, nothing spiritual—we all wear name-tags!) had been selected for their good looks and ethnic diversity. But I thought I was being cynical.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: I overheard maybe ten conversations between geeks (It was a web conference, after all) about the &#8220;religious people/ god-folk/ Christian nutters&#8221;, and my heart sank. One or two said that a cheery greeting first thing in the morning is quite nice. Most, however, thought they were over-bearing, weird, or strangely sexy.</p>
<p>The thing that gets me here, is that the public image of Jesus&#8217; followers is horribly maimed here. Wasn&#8217;t it Jesus who through money-changers out of the temple? Wasn&#8217;t it Jesus who went to societies low-lifes and changed their worlds? You think he would have scored well with a PR agency? Think he had a Marketing team or cheer-leaders?</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing spiritual they [Arab investors in the venue] get is this:&#8221; and the cabby rubbed his fingers in the international symbol of money.</p>
<p>What should I say to this? I&#8217;m lost for words&#8230;</p>

<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged">
<div style="width: 153px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Image:Fulton.jpg"><img title="February 11: Fulton patents steamboat." src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/202px-Fulton.jpg?resize=143%2C204" alt="February 11: Fulton patents steamboat." width="143" height="204" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>
</div>
<p>I have begun to see that we may be entering a new age of polymaths, and I&#8217;m happy to be involved in a part of the business world which seems to sustain some of the best brains on the planet.</p>
<p>I remember reading about the beginners of industry—the pioneers of technology and science. I remember reading how <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Robert_Fulton">Robert Fulton</a> came up against problems in life, and simply invented new ways of doing things, leading eventually to the development of steam-powered paddle-wheel-boats. I remember, vaguely, from my propagandistically pro-industrial schooling that as a child, Fulton had invented or improved on the lead pencil, because the one he was using in school wasn&#8217;t up to scratch. The same story is reflected through many of the West&#8217;s inventors of what we&#8217;ve retrospectively come to call <a class="zem_slink" title="Industrial Revolution" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Industrial_Revolution">the Industrial Revolution</a>: when opportunity or difficulty forced their hands, they changed the situation.</p>
<p>Now, aside from natural romanticism, I like to look to the past with neither rose-tinted glasses nor &#8220;isn&#8217;t-everything-better-now&#8221; short-sightedness. I&#8217;m sure that for every changer, there were crowds of followers in every age, and I&#8217;m sure many of you could point easily to both an earth-changer and a follower without too much effort. Besides, history pays scant attention to followers.</p>
<p>No, what I&#8217;m talking about is the seeming ease with which many of my colleagues in the web industry switch between impressively diverse tasks. Some I know make impressive presenters, and happen to hold PhD&#8217;s in fields more or less unrelated to what they do now&#8230; and can code Java and know a bit of <a class="zem_slink" title="Cascading Style Sheets" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> on the side. I fear to challenge any to play chess (since I haven&#8217;t played in over 5 years, and have the patience of a twelve-year-old), and several are rumoured to be better-than-average musicians. This diversified excellence, alongside the startups, ideas, enthusiastic organisations and programmes i&#8217;ve seen recently, remind me of the society-changers of a century and more ago. Not since then, I think, has such an importance been placed on ambition within social responsibilities.</p>

<p>One of the things I&#8217;ve seen most recently has been the Google 10^100 (apparently pronounced: ten to the one-hundredth with a typically geeky need to explain the pun) which aims to &#8220;help as many people as we can&#8221; by contributing $10million to fund earth-changing ideas. Their site is, in classic Google fashion, very straightforward, so I won&#8217;t repeat their blurb&#8230;just go have a read. But, while you are doing it, I dare you to set aside any cynicism you may harbour either toward a big business, or to any notion of &#8220;changing the world&#8221;. Think about what has and is being done, and then think how you could change the world.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always had a love/hate relationship with sleep. I can remember being so upset I couldn&#8217;t sleep because I had to go to bed. Maybe this has bled into the present.</p>
<p>The funny part of it all, is I&#8217;d much rather not be asleep most of the time. My wife has always confused me with her desire, pretty continuously, to be unconscious. There is so much to think about, to read, to play, to discuss—why sleep?</p>
<p>So, now, it&#8217;s 2:15. I know that tomorrow I will feel wretched, and that can&#8217;t help. It started by me so very nearly falling asleep around 11:00. It&#8217;s been boiling, and I don&#8217;t really get on well with hot weather—especially when it&#8217;s so humid. I thought I had it tonight, though, with a nice cool bath, then In bed at a reasonable time to watch My Family with Wendy on <a class="zem_slink" title="BBC iPlayer" rel="homepage" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iplayer">iPlayer</a>. That ended, so I switched on &#8220;Just a Minute&#8221; and turned down the screen until it was dark. I dozed off towards the end, only to be woken by something beeping somewhere. It stopped, but the damage had been done.</p>
<p>Next I switched on &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Quote... Unquote" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/Quote..._Unquote">Quote, Unquote</a>&#8221; and walked downstairs for a glass of water, and had a bottle of lager instead, hoping the little alcohol might help a bit. It&#8217;s so much cooler down stairs, so I decided to remove myself to the sofa, still with &#8220;Quote, Unquote&#8221;. I had just settled when my phone dinged. It had finally delivered a message to Wendy, I&#8217;d sent before dinner. Then, after settling in again, Wendy&#8217;s phone received the text message. Her phone, a new one, now beeps every few minutes until the message&#8217;s been read&#8230; another trip across the room.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when it started raining: by now I&#8217;m 15-minutes deep in Gardener&#8217;s Question Time. At last, it&#8217;s cooling off. Then it starts with the Thunder—which I have always hated. This rain literally poured down, and the thunder went through the house with a shuddering thud.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Gardeners' Question Time" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/Gardeners%27_Question_Time">Gardeners&#8217; Question Time</a> gave way to &#8220;Word of Mouth&#8221;, which I can&#8217;t remember. By then I was feeling anxious, about literally nothing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the oddest feeling: beginning like discomfort, then a physical sensation in my arms. Finally, I can&#8217;t be horizontal any longer, and it&#8217;s another walk across to the smaller settee. I can&#8217;t actually put a thought to this ridiculous anxiety. I&#8217;m not scared about anything, really. My job&#8217;s brilliant, my mates are fantastic, and my Wife&#8217;s amazing. Sure, not everything&#8217;s perfect, but I&#8217;m not even thinking about my painful back or where I&#8217;m at with God or any of the other possible panic producers.</p>
<p>I decided to share, and it seems to help. The thunder&#8217;s past, my arms don&#8217;t feel funny, and I&#8217;m not worried at nothing. It&#8217;s just this strange, almost twilight of the night: 2:32. I ache a bit, which isn&#8217;t good, and I feel like moaning online is a bit sad.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d hate to meet me in the morning.</p>

<p>I have a quite deep, wooden desk with drawers which tend to fill with clutter. I&#8217;ve decided to feed a powerstrip through the back of one of the drawers so I can plug in two usb hubs and my MacBook power cable there, out of the way. I&#8217;ve also managed to organise a system for filing my papers (I hate paper, it should always be on screen and searchable!) loosely based on the GTD (Getting Things Done) meme.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ve done is to mount a powerstrip to the back of the desk, so I lose some of the trailing cables. It still amazes me, though, how many wires a single of<a href="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2613549142_7f63c351d7.jpg?w=240" class="lightview" rel="gallery[desk]"><img alt="Office Space" title="Officespace" style="max-width: 800px; float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2613549142_7f63c351d7.jpg?w=240" height="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>fice space can generate! There&#8217;s still a cluttered feeling to the desk, and there&#8217;s nothing on it aside from computing paraphanelia.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning to put some shelves behind the monitor—the desk is very deep—on which to place external hard-drive and other necessities. I&#8217;d like to hide the cables behind it somehow, so they aren&#8217;t trailing in any way. I&#8217;ve bundled all the cabling with wire ties, and fed most leads through the monitor back, creating a funnel. The overall appearance, though, is still a bit too ad-hoc or rustic or&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>What do you think? What would you do with this desk space?</p>
