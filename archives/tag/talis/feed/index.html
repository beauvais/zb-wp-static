								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>
  Every aspect of society and economy that has been touched by the Web has been changed radically. Even the way we interact socially is very different to 15 years ago. &#8230; These changes are being brought about by the Web’s ability to link documents together into a single information space. The Semantic Web extends this to link anything and as such the potential for radical change in our society is vast.
</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">–<em>Ian Davis—Nodalities 2nd Ed</em></p>
<p>Every week, I used to receive a few emails along these lines:</p>
<p><strong><em>Subject: Nodalities, I hope this is OK?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Hi Zach, I&#8217;ve attached my story for Nodalities, and would like to know what you think?</em></p>
<p><em>Best Regards,</em></p>
<p><em>Someone Awesome</em></p>
<p>For three years, I had the chance to read the stories of many of the Semantic Web&#8217;s most exciting developers before anyone else. I was allowed to tell them that I really enjoyed their story—and ask if we could cut it down from 5,000 words to a bit more like 1,000; you know, if you don&#8217;t mind?</p>
<p>Then, I would pull together a generous handful of these stories every couple months and ask our designers to put them between the thick, matte paper covers of what everyone in the office called Nodmag.</p>
<p>The magazine&#8217;s aim was to be the Semantic Web&#8217;s first regular industry publication. We were building a platform for sharing Linked Data and wanted to share news from across the whole industry. I had somehow ended up appearing in Nodalities&#8217; second edition as a co-author with <a title="Ian Davis" href="http://twitter.com/iand">Ian Davis,</a> discussing the Semantic Web as a blue-ocean opportunity.</p>
<p>Before the third issue, my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulMiller">Paul Miller</a> handed me the reigns, and I learned a hell of a lot in those first few months. I enjoyed asking people if they&#8217;d ever considered writing up their project in an article-like piece of prose. This in itself taught me much about collaborative projects, to see how many people were willing to put in extra time to write about their passion and share their skill. It also introduced me to some of the most articulate technologists, who often crystallised abstract and often staggeringly complicated ideas into a form anyone interested in the Web could appreciate.</p>
<p>Editing itself is something I found profoundly enjoyable, and I miss the chance to see the first version of an article, and to work through fixing punctuation and nudging syntax without altering the meaning – adding my own semantic layer to the semantic web. The most rewarding element was working with semantic web people who didn&#8217;t realize they <em>could</em> tell their story. With just a few nudges and hints, their enthusiasm won, and overpowered some restraints of self-conscious writing.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9084" data-permalink="https://beggingaquestion.com/archives/nodmag/editors-notes/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/editors-notes_zlkpci.png?fit=484%2C598&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="484,598" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="editors-notes" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/editors-notes_zlkpci.png?fit=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/editors-notes_zlkpci.png?fit=484%2C598&amp;ssl=1" class="alignleft wp-image-9084" title="editors-notes" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/editors-notes_zlkpci.png?w=1090" alt="semantic web editors notes" data-recalc-dims="1" />I absorbed a lot of information about linking data and applying web technologies, and watched the story unfold from a slightly removed position. Our first articles, for example, tended to look forward—expecting proof-of-concepts and apps in-the-wild.</p>
<p>Over time, the stories began to sound different in tone as they slowly shifted from expectation to sharing progress and discussing work underway. We also saw meticulous research from universities and science institutes. Although being a scholarly journal was beyond the general remit, many academics shared their findings with Nodalities&#8217; audience, kindly writing at a level even I could understand.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2011—amid some <a title="Talis sells library" href="http://www.information-age.com/talis-sells-off-library-software-business-to-focus-on-semantic-web-1607743/">big changes at Talis</a>—I took up the place as community manager in the data marketplace, Kasabi. As a startup, Kasabi really demanded full attention, and I could no longer commit to running the magazine. Also, despite doing the publishing several years, we had never pretended to be a proper publisher, and I had sincerely hoped Nodalities would be superseded by journalists whose coverage of our emerging industry should fare better than one blogging/community chap at a software company could do. So, I put together the last editor&#8217;s notes to appear next to a truly terrible portrait for the final issue in late spring, 2011.</p>
<p>I met incredibly interesting people, and editing is something I very much hope to have the chance to do again someday. I feel honoured to have been first to read these stories, and hope any influence I may have had didn&#8217;t get in the way of the developers&#8217; voices.</p>
<p>Last week, following Talis&#8217; major shift of direction, I felt nostalgic, and wanted to pour over some of the older copies of Nodmag. Alas, I found them missing. I&#8217;ve since heard that there are some plans to archive the site, and to have a home for the magazine somewhere, but in the meantime the back issues of Nodalities are available on github: <a title="Nodalites on Github" href="http://github.com/beauvais/nodalities">github.com/beauvais/nodalities</a>.</p>
<h3 id="edit-final-editors-notes">EDIT: Final Editor&#8217;s Notes</h3>
<hr />
<p>Nodalities has, for three years, told stories from around the ever-expanding sphere of Linked Data. As Editor, I have had the privilege of helping to tell those stories, to meet so many interesting people, and take part in the growth of the Linked Data community.</p>
<p>This will be Nodalities’ final edition.</p>
<p>At Talis, we have never been a media or publishing company&#8211;we build data platforms and applications&#8211;but Nodalities was created to help our community grow and give a voice to those joining and building with us. The magazine has fulfilled it’s purpose, and I am very happy for other media now to take responsibility for telling its stories.</p>
<p>As a final issue, I do not want to look back for context, but forward to new and emerging developments on the Web of Data. So, I have the added privilege of presenting a collection of stories with an emphasis on starting up for the final time.</p>
<p>If you would like to get in touch about any of these stories, or would like to catch up with me about what Talis is working on next, please feel free to contact me on zb@talis.com</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Zach Beauvais</p>

<p>Should I begin biographically, and tell a story, ending with: &#8220;and now, I&#8217;m on to something new,&#8221;?</p>
<p>When I met Talis towards the end of 2007, I knew very little about the web, but suffered from a problem of perspective and believed I knew quite a bit.</p>
<p>I had just finished my first post-university job in online marketing, project-managing some pretty big site constructions and ticking lots of boxes for &#8220;new media&#8221;. I became the webby chap for a non-webby company because my degree in linguistics didn&#8217;t finish with any direction towards a career without paying more to do MA&#8217;s and certificates, or travel abroad teaching English. I focused on semantics, and found myself applying for marketing jobs in order to pay the rent. And I knew about the web.</p>
<p>When I was 12ish, I played around with the web a lot, using excellent tools like Netscape Composer to learn HTML and masterfully arrange content across table cells. I have a proper geek dad, who has written millions of lines of code in over a dozen languages, so some of that must have put me into a position of thinking I understood the web better than my friends (who didn&#8217;t tend to use it at all then.) I grew from that to bothering my friends about proper standards and browsers, then secretly installing Firefox on their computers.</p>
<p>I was kind of trying to merge the two ideas of semantics and the web into something I could wrap my head around, and started writing about some webby trends. After a few posts to ZDNet&#8217;s Web 2.0 Explorer blog, I started writing a few pieces for ReadWriteWeb, and they asked me to profile a company down the road from me called Talis. I enjoyed our introduction, and asked if I could do anything for Talis, seeing that we were virtually neighbours and we both liked semantics.</p>
<p>For the next 4 years, I had my perspective realigned. I quickly realised that I knew nothing whatsoever about the web. After a few months, I started to learn that I knew very little about many things. But, conversations with insightfully intelligent people made this transition exciting instead of shattering. It&#8217;s hard to say – without sounding well up oneself – something about learning helping you understand that you know less than you thought you did: insert something attributed to Socrates.</p>
<p>But hearing about the web from Talisians like Ian Davis, Tom Heath and Rob Styles (to name three who put up with me a lot for several years) is a good way to learn. Through Nodalities, I learned from an even wider circle of clever people, pulled together through Talis&#8217; industry support and open nature.</p>
<p>Talis has been a good friend of mine, and has taught me much about the web, and left me with a much better perspective. I know – now – that I know very little about the web, technology and semantics. But I do realise that I&#8217;m better at leaning, and have had my head expanded by kind and interesting people.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will be saying farewell to my friend Talis, and will promise to keep in touch and send postcards as I move up North to Yorkshire and start living and working somewhere new.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>|This article first appeared in Nodalities Magazine, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2">CC By + SA</a></strong></p>
<p>For anyone following the Nodalities blog, you may have read some of my recent posts discussing the trends boiling up around Web 3.0 (other buzzwords are available). The Mobile Web and upgraded connectivity in general; the rise of ubiquitous computing from chips in every product imaginable; Linked Data and the “Semantic Web” as an organising platform for this rising tide of data—these are three very broad trends seeing a lot of media attention presently. From where I’m standing, I tend to see the next great turning point of the Web as a convergence of some of these trends, and see it as a rise in the importance of and reliance upon data itself and data tools generally.</p>
<p>The mobile web is bringing new sorts of information to people, and they can make use of this info wherever they happen to be because of advances in devices ad connectivity. As phones and web-enabled devices get better, so to do the chips we seem to have embedded all over the place, and we can now begin to have a more clear picture of what we do through the information we gather from our heaters, cars, and pedometers. Also, as more objects become connected, the grunt-work of number-crunching and storage is becoming commoditised into big, efficient, utility-like cloud services, which host and work with our collected information much more effectively than the gadget in your hand could ever hope to do. Others, like us here at Talis, talk about the Semantic Web, which allows for an evolution from a bunch of connected documents to the explicit connections between bits of information.</p>
<p>Also fermenting in this mix is a strengthening trend of political transparency and a public, shared ownership of social data. Barack Obama’s new administration has clearly made this a priority with the launch and work around data.gov; and in the UK, Sir Tim Berners-Lee himself has been appointed to an Parliamentary advisory role. There is growing pressure to be able to have access to public data, and to see it as belonging to the nation’s people rather than allowed to be legitimately filed away in the great, locked bureau of the capitols.</p>
<p>So, picking up two fairly obvious trends here: Social, Public Data and Linked Data; it would seem to follow that people would begin to have access to previously unavailable information in usable, linked forms. And it’s certainly beginning, as articles elsewhere in this magazine have illustrated. But, what about other chunks of public data? What about when data comes from universities, institutions, scientific foundations and NGO’s? What about charities monitoring crime, CO2 emissions and family histories? Wouldn’t these make a useful piece in the web of social data? What resources have the governments themselves got, if they want to make their public-owned data available in a useful format?</p>
<p>These questions form a major part of the thinking behind Talis’ Connected Commons initiative (talis.com/cc). Basically, Talis has made its Semantic Web platform (including data hosting and access tools) available free of charge for any datasets made available to the public. In doing so, we’re hoping to remove the barrier of cost entirely to publishing interesting data in a Linked Data way. One major reason for this is to promote reuse and mashups of this interesting data, and for people to be able to “follow their noses” to the data that completes their projects. But, from a publishers’ perspective, this is important, because it’s removing a major reason not to bother with making data useful, if not only public. So, with this, data can be made public and useable and the developers and users get the benefit of public SPARQL endpoints and API access to interesting data.</p>
<p>To keep the data open and public, datasets need to make use of either the Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) or Creative Commons’ CC0 license. Ian Davis, in his article in this magazine, explains more about waivers and the Connected Commons, and there is a lot more about this particular initiative over on the Talis site (talis.com/platform/cc/faqs/).</p>
<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Sir Tim said: “This is our data. This is our taxpayers’ money which has created this data, so I would like to be able to see it, please.” I wonder if initiatives such as Connected Commons will begin to remove excuses, hindrances, and obstacles? As public awareness of the importance of access gets hotter, this might become a political issue, as well as a pragmatic one. I hope that in the rush to publish data, and in the ensuing discussion and debate that follows, that the users, hackers and developers don’t get sidelined. I think the world is ready for its data back.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>|This first appeared as a <a href="http://readwrite.com/2009/08/04/journalism_needs_data_in_21st_century/">guest post on ReadWriteWeb</a>, republished with kind permission</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beauvais/3791106495/sizes/o/"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 10px;" title="Not News" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2515/3791106495_d9c4cd9d08_m.jpg?resize=193%2C240" alt="" width="193" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Journalism has always been about reporting facts and assertions and making sense of world affairs. No news there. But as we move further into the 21st century, we will have to increasingly rely on &#8220;data&#8221; to feed our stories, to the point that &#8220;data-driven reporting&#8221; becomes second nature to journalists.</p>
<p>The shift from facts to data is subtle and makes perfect sense. You could that say data <em>are</em> facts, with the difference that they can be computed, analysed, and made use of in a more abstract way, especially by a computer.</p>
<p>With this mindset, finding mainstream data-driven stories doesn&#8217;t take long at all. A quick scan of the Guardian&#8217;s home page tells us that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jul/16/swine-flu-cases-rise-britain">swine flu cases are up by 50%</a>, according to &#8220;fresh figures&#8230;[that] will be released this afternoon.&#8221; The story here is that we&#8217;re in danger because swine flu is on the rise. Reporting the current figures available for swine flu alone wouldn&#8217;t be all that interesting. The news comes from comparing the current figures to last week&#8217;s, which is a very simple form of data analysis. By making use of published data and running one&#8217;s own analysis (and building on the analysis of others), we get something very news-worthy indeed. It moves the definition ever so slightly, from &#8220;saying and asserting&#8221; to &#8220;analyzing and publishing.&#8221; But it obviously works only for data that is accessible.</p>
<p>There is nothing new about pointing out the importance of public data being made available. <a class="zem_slink" title="Tim Berners-Lee" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> has discussed at length the importance of governments and institutions putting their data online, making it accessible and useful. His <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/484">TED talk</a> and interviews with <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/interview_with_tim_berners-lee_part_1.php">ReadWriteWeb</a> and Talis (disclosure: I am a blogger at Talis) all explain his belief that by publishing <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/linked_data_is_blooming_why_you_should_care.php">linked data</a> we can begin to solve many of the problems the world faces. Innovations in medicine, science, and development could all be achieved if only currently hidden data were made available. Data-driven journalism could be the first step in realizing this dream. The best stories would then come from innovators who read about trends reported in news media and are then able to draw new conclusions and solve bigger problems. In his recent discussion with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/06/sir_tims_cry_raw_data_now.html">BBC</a>, Berners-Lee said that the next step is to go for low-hanging fruit by just getting the data out there.</p>
<p>Thus far, this has made a lot of sense to me, and I have been tracking the publication of linked data and increasing access to public knowledge as emerging trends over at Talis. But my perspective has shifted a bit in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>First, there was <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a> and President Obama&#8217;s call for more access to government data. A sitting head of state (and one of some significance) was clearly calling for public access to government data: this was news! But the idea has been discussed, praised, and debated for a while since then and may have <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/datagov_finally_launches_looks_nice_but_short_on_d.php">lost some of its luster</a>.</p>
<p>Then about a month ago, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown made it part of his digital strategy to prioritize the publication of government information. He asked Sir Tim personally &#8220;to help us drive the opening up of access to Government data in the web over the coming months&#8221; and appointed Berners-Lee an official governmental adviser. By now, neither of these stories is news and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/open_goverment_berners-lee_and_the_uk_to_show_obam.php">comparisons between the initiatives</a> have been made.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="The Guardian" rel="homepage" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian</a> newspaper recently launched its own <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/mar/10/blogpost1">Data Blog</a>, with the intention of letting readers access, mash up, and reuse much of its information in the form of data, which could in turn drive stories.</p>
<p>What is perhaps not as explicitly recognized is the voracious appetite for data that has been apparent for months. It is less about turning good ideas into stories and more about seeing how data informs our understanding of events happening right now. Each new initiative is another piece of low-hanging fruit picked.</p>
<p>Access to data is important: it drives innovation and even social change. Governments that publish their data <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/what_can_you_do_with_government_data.php">have to become more transparent</a>. Humanitarian organizations that make their findings known could spark bigger projects and source innovative solutions from their communities. Scientific findings and raw information could be used to solve bigger problems than the result of a single experiment or trial could ever manage. Even the simple comparison of two or more facts can lead to new insight, and all of these things happen only when the walls around an institution become porous.</p>
<p>2009 could become known as the year of data, the year of open access, or the year of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Semantic Web" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic Web</a> (see links above for how this relates), and it may also be the first year when it becomes news that data wasn&#8217;t published in a story when it should have been. That a government body isn&#8217;t being transparent or is blocking access by publishing its findings in PDF or other non-linking formats would make a very interesting story indeed. We can expect to see more and more organizations and public bodies remove their own barriers through initiatives and legislation. Examples have been set, and seeing excuses die along with barriers is not far-fetched.</p>
<p>Do you know of other data-driven stories? We&#8217;d love to hear about any insights that were made through publicly accessible data or where this data might come from next.</p>

Innovation, if you like, occurs at the join between ideas when they connect. I see this as fundamental to the way ideas and their applications (technology) advance. I tend to believe that anything &#8220;novel&#8221; is actually affected when other ideas are connected together.</p>
<p>In the technological world, this seems like a strong analogy for Linked Data: information which can be connected by a web-like network of links. These Linked Data have become the foundation for what has come to be known as the “Semantic Web”, a web of connected information which breaks out of information silos and enables the discovery of new ideas from old, and innovation from existing information. We use the phrase &#8220;serendipitous reuse&#8221; for the idea that once an idea (or a piece of data) is published, it can be used and reused in novel ways and in context of other data to produce unexpected, and unforeseeable possibilities. These ideas (data, again) become increasingly useful when published in a format which allows them to be linked freely to ANY other piece of information. We&#8217;ve had the distribution method for this network for years (the good, ol WWW itself) and it&#8217;s been about a year since  RDF was launched by the WWW Consortium to handle the data itself. The idea is basically to give every bit of data an address (a universal address, not one subjective to a database like a cell reference), and to predicate that bit of information very much like language does. If you think of it like a language, RDF lets bits of data (nouns) to be acted upon or act upon (verbs) others (other nouns). This triple-format enables a near infinite recombination (theoretically) of any data, anywhere with an address.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the problem? Well, most of the world&#8217;s data are locked away in silos (prisoners of the cells their databases confine them to). Many organisations may wish to make use of their data in a semantic environment, and many might even embrace the Open-source nature of their data, and make it freely available to the world to recombine and use: there are always more innovations outside an organisation than within! In order to lower barriers to enter this linked data world, Talis has built a Platform with resources to host and utilise these connections, making use of semantic web standards (RDF and SPARQL, the query language of the semantic web) and a developer-friendly environment (a RESTFul API, for example).</p>
<p>However, this innovation is only possible when data are accessible. In order to further lower the barriers, Talis is now offering free access to the Platform to host public domain data. We are calling this initiative the Talis Connected Commons, and the offer is not limited to free hosting: the data access services, including access to a public SPARQL endpoint, are also freely available. To keep this data open, you will need to use either the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/1">Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License</a> or the recently launched <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/zero">Creative Commons CC0 license</a> to publish data. Anyone will then be able to freely access the stored data using the Platform services, without API keys and without usage limits.</p>
<p>There is more information available at www.talis.com/cc, where you can find detailed technical information, FAQ’s and other resources.</p>

Their list of speakers sounds fantastic, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to meeting some folks in real life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m particularly interested in this conference for its stated focus on the web community. Just have a look at the Agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li> How to grow and nurture your community</li>
<li> Work/life balance or Blood, sweat and tears: Which is the startup way?</li>
<li> Colliding Worlds: Using Jabber to make awesome web sites</li>
<li> Startups live &#8211; An interview with three new European startups</li>
<li> How to survive outside of Silicon Valley</li>
</ul>
<div>Sounds good, doesn&#8217;t it?</div>
<div>There are also &#8220;Networking Opportunities&#8221; there. These sound brilliant despite the rather corporatese description.</div>
<div>They&#8217;ve apparently got seats left, and if you book before 4th August, you save £100.</div>
<div>If you&#8217;re going, let me know—we can meet up. I can tell you a bit about myself and Talis.</div>
