<p>I&#8217;ve always had a love/hate relationship with sleep. I can remember being so upset I couldn&#8217;t sleep because I had to go to bed. Maybe this has bled into the present.</p>
<p>The funny part of it all, is I&#8217;d much rather not be asleep most of the time. My wife has always confused me with her desire, pretty continuously, to be unconscious. There is so much to think about, to read, to play, to discuss—why sleep?</p>
<p>So, now, it&#8217;s 2:15. I know that tomorrow I will feel wretched, and that can&#8217;t help. It started by me so very nearly falling asleep around 11:00. It&#8217;s been boiling, and I don&#8217;t really get on well with hot weather—especially when it&#8217;s so humid. I thought I had it tonight, though, with a nice cool bath, then In bed at a reasonable time to watch My Family with Wendy on <a class="zem_slink" title="BBC iPlayer" rel="homepage" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iplayer">iPlayer</a>. That ended, so I switched on &#8220;Just a Minute&#8221; and turned down the screen until it was dark. I dozed off towards the end, only to be woken by something beeping somewhere. It stopped, but the damage had been done.</p>
<p>Next I switched on &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Quote... Unquote" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/Quote..._Unquote">Quote, Unquote</a>&#8221; and walked downstairs for a glass of water, and had a bottle of lager instead, hoping the little alcohol might help a bit. It&#8217;s so much cooler down stairs, so I decided to remove myself to the sofa, still with &#8220;Quote, Unquote&#8221;. I had just settled when my phone dinged. It had finally delivered a message to Wendy, I&#8217;d sent before dinner. Then, after settling in again, Wendy&#8217;s phone received the text message. Her phone, a new one, now beeps every few minutes until the message&#8217;s been read&#8230; another trip across the room.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when it started raining: by now I&#8217;m 15-minutes deep in Gardener&#8217;s Question Time. At last, it&#8217;s cooling off. Then it starts with the Thunder—which I have always hated. This rain literally poured down, and the thunder went through the house with a shuddering thud.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Gardeners' Question Time" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/Gardeners%27_Question_Time">Gardeners&#8217; Question Time</a> gave way to &#8220;Word of Mouth&#8221;, which I can&#8217;t remember. By then I was feeling anxious, about literally nothing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the oddest feeling: beginning like discomfort, then a physical sensation in my arms. Finally, I can&#8217;t be horizontal any longer, and it&#8217;s another walk across to the smaller settee. I can&#8217;t actually put a thought to this ridiculous anxiety. I&#8217;m not scared about anything, really. My job&#8217;s brilliant, my mates are fantastic, and my Wife&#8217;s amazing. Sure, not everything&#8217;s perfect, but I&#8217;m not even thinking about my painful back or where I&#8217;m at with God or any of the other possible panic producers.</p>
<p>I decided to share, and it seems to help. The thunder&#8217;s past, my arms don&#8217;t feel funny, and I&#8217;m not worried at nothing. It&#8217;s just this strange, almost twilight of the night: 2:32. I ache a bit, which isn&#8217;t good, and I feel like moaning online is a bit sad.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d hate to meet me in the morning.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have come to the conclusion, after being without a car for five years, that travel by rail in the UK is just about the most infuriating process you can undertake on a regular basis. Every day, one of my 6 train journeys to or from work will fail in some way or other. Either there will be a delay, a last-minute platform change, a cancellation&#8230; something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Looking at the complexity of the rail network, it&#8217;s not surprising that it doesn&#8217;t always run exactly right. However, since I can pretty much guarantee that my train journey to work or back will be compromised in some way, I&#8217;m starting to wonder. There is no &#8216;normal&#8217; service, you see. It&#8217;s a myth that the trains usually make it on time. Perhaps it is more than 50% of each leg of any given journey&#8230; maybe. But at some stage in every multi-sectioned journey I&#8217;ve had, some aspect of the trip fails.</p>
<p>II&#8217;m beginning to wonder what could possibly fix this situation. I&#8217;m told daily by an electronic voice: &#8220;I&#8217;m extremely sorry for the severe delay to this service.&#8221; I wonder what rail executives hope to achieve by creating an automated apology system? It&#8217;s not exactly like it&#8217;s a good value for money trade-off either. Train travel is bloody expensive, and it doesn&#8217;t work the majority of the time.</p>
<p>Maybe executive heads need to roll, maybe a huge infusion of public money needs injecting into the system, maybe&#8230; they need a change of perspective. If they measure every individual step in a day, they might come to the conclusion that they&#8217;ve failed n number of times. n=number of delayed, cancelled or otherwise compromised phases of transit between any two given points on the network. However, if X represents the full journey of an individual in a sampled population, and X is made up of a number of phases, I wonder how many X&#8217;s would end up compromised in some way?</p>
<p>Sample 100 complete journeys across the entire network. Each journey is an individual X (complete from point A to B with each stop and change included). Each completed leg of any given X could be designated y, and any compromised legs (including additionally-accrued attrition from one failed leg compromising another) could be w&#8217;s.</p>
<p>There are two numbers I&#8217;d be interested in seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ratio of y&#8217;s to w&#8217;s across the sampled population&#8217;s collective X&#8217;s</li>
<li>The number of X&#8217;s which contain at least one w</li>
</ul>
<p>I reckon and predict, that these numbers would reflect very unfavorably on the network&#8217;s ability to run itself.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the fix?</p>
<p>No idea&#8230; though I do worry no one in the rail network has any clue either.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tend to live in a world of metaphor. It&#8217;s not my fault, according to Lakoff and Johnson. We all use metaphor all the time: to construct our thoughts and work out abstract concepts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been exploring this a bit in the context of the Semantic Web over on Nodalities. Please feel free to have a look and send me some feedback on what you think about this set of ideas.</p>
