								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/twitter_banned_from_white_house.php">read</a> yesterday that twitter has been banned from the White House. In the post, Marshall Kirkpatrick joked that this could be a reason we haven&#8217;t seen much from Obama&#8217;s twitter stream recently. I must admit however, my initial reaction was sympathetic with the White House for pragmatic reasons, though the attitude of the Press Secretary&#8217;s attitude towards &#8220;twitterers&#8221; did raise the hackles. It makes sense to be secure in the White House, to make sure people aren&#8217;t saying things which could be dangerous or cause scandal through carelessness. &#8220;Loose lips sink ships&#8221;, don&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>But I think there is a wider idea here, which I think I&#8217;ve glimpsed between the lines.</p>

I use it to pass on little observations, like you might to a room full of mates, when there isn&#8217;t anyone there to share with directly. News of Michael Jackson&#8217;s death reached me via an off-colour joke on twitter. These are uses for a technology which it would be difficult to commend.</p>
<p>However, I also use twitter to share news. When my grandfather recently passed away, I received dozens of messages of encouragement and sympathy. Several of us here in Shropshire organise a monthly get together to network and discuss tech-trends and the work we do through the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/shropgeek">@shropgeek</a>. Important announcements at work, and shared interest groups often rely on twitter for their spread and response, and I&#8217;ve had customer service reps from big companies personally respond to my feedback. Of far more significance, the government of Iran was unable to stop twitter, allowing its citizens to tell the rest of the world what was going on when all other forms of communication were censored, blocked, or monitored. And citizens from around the rest of the world responded.</p>
<p>twitter is a medium, and suggesting someone is petty and fatuous because they use it is like suggesting everyone on TV is unimportant or vain. There is no connection between the inane talk-show host and the investigative journalist or head of state! The point is in the message, not the vehicle. But, the point this raises in my mind is that twitter, and other forms of web-enabled channels make for a high level of transparency, and I don&#8217;t think the US (in particular) is a power who likes transparency at the moment.</p>
<p>This has lead me to question what I think of the use of web-media by politicians and important figures, particularly in the US and UK. It makes me wonder whether the &#8220;Loose lips&#8221; philosophy is misguided in the modern world. You see, closing channels, blocking communication, and monitoring messages suggests a democracy that doesn&#8217;t trust its citizens with the truth. Sure, there are controls and securities which must be in place, and I&#8217;m not suggesting for a moment that every clerk should have a constitutional right to twitter state-secrets&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;or am I?</p>
<p>You see, the United States is global super-power on par with, and probably only directly comparable with great states of the past called Empires. The notion of an emperor of the US would chill the blood of most of my family, and thinking of the US as anything but a &#8220;democracy&#8221; is practically heresy. After all, citizens&#8217; rights are ensconced in the very foundation myth and history of the US itself. &#8220;We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal&#8230;&#8221; begins a letter to a despotic monarch, sparking off the touch-pad for liberating men from the rule of figureheads, class and social bondage. But part of this very myth* that the Republic, &#8220;of the people, by the people and for the people&#8221; should be based on citizenship trusted to look after themselves and even take up arms to defend their status as such citizens. There is a deep-running notion in the American psyche that if the government were ever to get too big for it&#8217;s boots, it is the right—nay, duty—of her citizens to act to reduce her power.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t believe the US is a state that can be corrected by its citizens very effectively at all.  I think of the complexity, size, presence and byzantine nature of the US Government, and I feel disconnected, small, and powerless to change anything. Over the past decade, in the name of security, Americans put up with reductions in liberty, and I think this principle is bleeding through the cracks in the facade of governance. Blocking channels is saying: &#8220;we don&#8217;t trust you&#8221;.</p>
<p>What would a country look like where the public had access to the vast majority of government information? Where government officially made use of the media its citizens used? Where government officials were held accountable via the various media whenever they were caught being mis-represented?</p>
<p>Oddly, I think it&#8217;s the UK.</p>
<p>The &#8220;traditional&#8221; media here are a powerful force. It is seen as a near human right to have intimate news of public officials and dealings, and watching politicians being interviewed by members of the press is like eaves-dropping on a job interview or witnessing a cautious father&#8217;s first meeting of a prospective suitor for his only daughter. The press is a force to be reckoned with here, and it&#8217;s not seen as the trustworthy force itself, but is is composed of citizens, not officials.</p>
<p>Does this scandalise the government? Yes&#8230; and no. There is a very different attitude toward elected officials here, which doesn&#8217;t translate easily to American. A Member of Parliament is legally referred to as &#8220;Honourable Member&#8221;, but the &#8220;honourable&#8221; is not taken as read by the average Brit. For decades, for example, Members of Parliament have enjoyed a system of expenses whereby they can claim for nearly every cost of living: from second homes to food and utilities. The true level of this feeding-trough has recently been blown wide by the press (who subsequently have been enjoying their own self-congratulatory feast, but that is another post.)</p>
<p>But, I think the UK get the web, probably because it&#8217;s used to dealing with powerful media. I follow Number 10 Downing Street (the metonymic residence of the Prime Minister) on twitter. No 10 doesn&#8217;t say much, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to expose any state secrets, but I like the fact that it&#8217;s there to be engaged. The Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) hosts an important blog which outlines the government&#8217;s plans to expose public data for normal, every-day citizens to have a play with and to see what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>And, in the last few weeks, the Prime Minister himself has turned himself around almost 180º in my personal opinion. He represents a party for whom I have less time than either of the other major contenders, and I&#8217;ve rather lazily accepted him as an incompetent oaf. But, he&#8217;s finally earned my pint and invite to dinner, if not my vote (if any of his secretaries are reading this, just tweet your acceptance, and I&#8217;ll find some pheasants and Pinotage). A few weeks ago, he appointed Sir Tim Berners-Lee to a Parliamentary advisory role with the explicit intention of opening up and pushing public data online. This is a <strong>major</strong> point, because it leads to transparency through public accountability. There seems to be a movement for Parliament to see public data as belonging to the people who bought it with their taxes, and this seems to be the most democratic way to see it. His recent <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/gordon_brown.html">TED talk</a> also made me think he&#8217;s got a lot more to say than he perhaps has to date; though I think many of his points raise more questions than they answer.</p>
<p>Much has been said in the online world about the new American administration&#8217;s use of social media and the web to mobilise supporters during the election. But there hasn&#8217;t been much since. President Obama launched <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/www.data.gov">data.gov</a>, but there is very little data there. I think the web is seen as a tool for messages, as a part of a bigger campaign, and as a security breach. It&#8217;s something to be used with your own agenda, and only under one&#8217;s own strict parameters. And, perhaps most non-democratically, it&#8217;s been used to broadcast and to cajole—It has not been used to engage. The fact that social media have barely been touched since the election could point to a wider attitude that citizens only matter for the brief time they&#8217;re required to vote.</p>
<p>The UK has already exposed much of its public data, and it&#8217;s planning to publish more and more as Linked Data (machine-readable, immediately useful resources), and it&#8217;s made plans to be more open, grasping the web and the transparency it&#8217;s brought through the hard lessons that spin is impossible with a well-informed citizenry, and on the Open Web, there is less room for your own message than there is for humanity.</p>
<p>*<em>mythos is greek for &#8220;story&#8221;, and it is from that perspective I use the word <em>myth</em>: that it conveys the notion of a commonly-held understanding, not that it is entirely fantastic or without truth.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many things I want to do to improve the way I live. My little plot of the world should be made greener through fantastic gardening skills. My waistline should be happily withering while my biceps should be steadily broadening—despite the physical reality that I&#8217;d entirely lose my middle that way. Dinner parties should be thrown matching an excruciatingly-chosen bottle of wine with exquisitely-prepared, locally-sourced, organic food followed by exciting coffee preferably prepared using some seldom-seen flavour-extracting gadget.</p>
<p>The reality is that I tend not to have much time to get the very basics of social-acceptability complete before forcing myself to sleep. Much of this is by choice, no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Facts:</strong> I&#8217;d rather read than sleep; I&#8217;d rather train the dog to retrieve three different dummies than wash up; and I&#8217;d rather cook an exciting dinner than pack a mundane yet healthy lunch.</p>
<p>Much of the time I have, however, is spent working and travelling to work, and trying to get done the things I (and my wife) feel need to be done. A bit of gardening to keep the neighbours from tutting, a bit of washing up so dinner can be made, and walking/training the pup so he doesn&#8217;t go mental and eat the cat, our house and the whole world&#8230;</p>
<p>I have realised, over the past few weeks, that much of my lifestyle is dependent on a web-connected world. That last sentence reads a bit like an obvious reality from a blogger and someone employed in web innovation; but I mean more than just &#8220;My job is dependent on the web&#8221;. I work from home half the week rather than commuting the 60+ miles to the office every day; and this requires web access, a vpn connection to work, and various communication services. But I also live in rural Shropshire, and tend to do most of my shopping online. I phone my family back in the states via Skype and keep in touch with friends, colleagues and acquaintances on Twitter. I even plan meetings, arranging transport and buy any travel tickets online. It would be impossible for me to live here and work as I do without a web-enabled life.</p>
<p>The web is part of this lifestyle, though, and there is actually more to this &#8220;connected&#8221; living than just the links on the web. You see, there is something more about organisation involved. It&#8217;s not just that I have a connection to a retail site, but that they&#8217;ve innovated their organisation to the point that I can buy most of what I need and want, have it delivered to my door the next day, and still save money and a HUGE amount of time. These connected companies (more in another blog post, probably) are taking advantage of scale to bring a service to web-enabled shoppers.</p>
<p>But its only recently that more interesting services have begun to spring out of this connected cloud of companies. I&#8217;ve talked about kiva.org, which organises charitable micro-finance loans through the medium of web-connection and building upon the shoulders of giants like PayPal, who were early innovators in organising payments online. But what about little things? Sure, we can change the world, but can we make a difference to, for example, how we eat tomorrow?</p>
<p>Enter: <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/www.graze.com">graze.com</a>. <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/www.dynamicorange.com">Rob</a> at the office jokingly calls them SaaS (Snacking as a Service). Graze sends a box of healthy and tasty snacks through the post to arrive on subscribed days of the week (i.e. I have mine delivered to the office on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays). Graze mixes fresh and dried fruit with nuts and other healthy snacks, for £2.99/box including postage. This is great, healthy food delivered regularly to my desk in time for lunch for less than £3/day!</p>
<p>Graze mixes a few recent innovations to produce this service. Rob&#8217;s comment surfaces the &#8220;as a Service&#8221; ethic, which essentially fills a particular need on a subscription business model via the web. It&#8217;s also reminiscent of jukeboxes or music subscriptions applications like Spotify or even iTunes, in that you can choose the level of detail you want to use in organising your snacking, or you can simply &#8220;shuffle&#8221; them, being surprised but putting no effort into planning.</p>
<p>The long/short? I&#8217;ve actually saved money, because I no longer pop out to a petrol station to spend £4 on a barely edible sandwich and snack. I feel better, because this food is actually, truly great for me and It feels nice to eat something light but sustaining when sitting at a desk for hours. I don&#8217;t skip lunch, so I&#8217;m less inclined to trough when I get home, and all by simply outsourcing my lunch!</p>
<p>What else needs organising in life? Tidying as a service? No? Clothing? Wardrobe as a Service? Ooh, if anyone wants a startup, I&#8217;ve got a great idea for a service that delivers clothes perhaps monthly to keep your wardrobe refreshed, or allows for special days (weddings, balls etc&#8230; too). What would you outsource, and what service would you provide?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m introducing old friends; but <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> is a &#8220;microbloggiing&#8221; platform, to give it its proper description. it gives users 140 characters to publish status updates, comments, gripes, complaints, praises, news and whatever comes to mind. It&#8217;s burst out of its original answer to the simple question: &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; and users often tweet just about everything.</p>
<p>One interesting innovation is the integration of the hashtag. Simply a hash symbol (#) and a tag descriptor for the comment. This gives people the ability to follow particular threads of updates or participate in conversations around an interest. They&#8217;re often used, for example, to update the goings on from conferences (#FOWA for example). People give their own content this little bit of information, and a search engine can find them. People can add additional information and follow conventions which allow for distributed trends that anyone can follow and interact with.</p>
<p>The recent snowfall in Britain gave rise to a flurry of tweets about road closures, amounts of snow falling, schools closing down and all the other chaos unleashed. When users followed a simple convention, however, this information got organised. People quickly adopted the #uksnow hashtag to track the topic; and eventually someone worked out a way to capture all the info needed to follow these geographically. By tweeting the first half of a UK post code plus a rating out of ten snowfall, anyone following the thread knows exactly where it&#8217;s snowing. It&#8217;s like an instant weather polling station, distributed across the country. It can go a step further, however, when services can actually mashup these tweets when users turn their simple status updates into a mini line of code.</p>
<p>This little bit of information allows for people to write software to track and automate the twitter information. This <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/snow">interactive map</a> from benmarsh.co.uk, for example, actually plots a visual graph of snowfall across Britain. Bigger snowflakes indicate larger numbers out of ten in the poll. It&#8217;s simple, really. Ingenious, possibly. But the fundamental distinction between this tracking ability and the noise of thousands of Twits shouting about the snow is that little bit of metadata.</p>
<p>So, is this use of twitter a metaphor for the Semantic Web? It&#8217;s certainly a picture of automating information flow using metadata via software. Sounds Semanticcy to me.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/zbeauvais">twitter</a> statistic-stuff a bit lately, and finding it interesting if not purposeful. A company called tweestats will graph your twitter updates; showing you trends, charts, and a &#8220;tweetcloud&#8221; which shows you your most-used words. I&#8217;ve changed mine to a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/www.wordle.net">wordle</a>, and thought I&#8217;d share it:</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="lightview" href="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/2596595550_50d53740c8_m.jpg"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px;" title="Blog image" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/2596595550_50d53740c8_m.jpg?resize=216%2C162" alt="" width="216" height="162" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Some of my long-term readers (hi, Mum) might remember that my original blog was a Drupal install, and that my less-than-lovely ISP dropped my connection as I was uploading some new files—therefore borking the CSS. If you don&#8217;t follow, that&#8217;s OK. The point is that my old site was Drupal (a heavy-duty Content Management System, which is fantastic) now it&#8217;s Wordperss (cause it does blogging, and does it well). Well, WordPress has won my geeky heart (it&#8217;s smaller than my cynical heart, and not as strong as my music heart, but probably the most covered here).</p>
<p>They have done one thing in the past month which has really, really impressed me. They&#8217;ve got a plugin which lets you upgrade to the latest version of their software (which you install on your webserver yourself) without any complicated, difficult-to-remember steps. This is why I lost Drupal: upgrading, and it killing itself in the transfer. Now, I have the latest WordPress, and I&#8217;m very impressed.</p>
<p>Its WYSIWYG editor works better, and the media manager is fantastic. As you probably know, I stopped using a local blogging client because ecto is rubbish, and Vista is worse. So I now blog from WordPress itself through Firefox on my Mac. Three things that make me happy: WordPress on Firefox running on a Mac&#8230; ah!</p>
<p>Another thing which is brilliant is the flickr sidebar plugin I have had for ages. I completely forgot to check out its &#8220;<a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/flickr">view more photos</a>&#8221; link. It automatically finds images from the sets I&#8217;ve told it about, and uses them to create a page on my site populated with my flickr stream images!</p>
<p>On a down side, I&#8217;ve just noticed that it&#8217;s impossible to see the bottom of the sidebar if Twitter is down, because I have my tweets (micro-blog messages) being pulled into a widget above it, so if it&#8217;s down, it doesn&#8217;t load the rest of the sidebar. I think that&#8217;s something WordPress should sort out. Oh, well. I&#8217;m just going to switch my images tab over to flickr.</p>
