<p>Following my <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/ipad-new/">post about using the iPad recently</a>, I&#8217;ve spent some time using more of the content-focused apps. As I mentioned before, the iPad has turned out to be a great device for consuming, reading and just experiencing media. This has obvious benefits for video, and many of the examples I&#8217;ve seen have made use of multi-media and show off the screen. But I tend to read a lot. I tend to read news from content publishers (BBC, Guardian, Gizmodo) and blogs.</p>
<p>One of the first apps I downloaded was Stephen Fry&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/id374277542?mt=8">FryPaper</a>&#8221; app. It&#8217;s basically Stephen Fry&#8217;s blog manifested as an iPad app, and it&#8217;s one of the most exciting things I&#8217;ve seen. This isn&#8217;t because it&#8217;s swish, flash, or gimmicky. Indeed, it is none of those things. It simply provides the content from Stephen&#8217;s blog in a format that is very, very easy to read on the iPad. It seems to focus on simple design, and that&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s got a very limited set of features, all of which I&#8217;ve used—like using the sharing feature to tweet or email links to individual articles.</p>
<p>So, why is this so exciting?</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s a glimpse of the future of well-published stories. It&#8217;s a snapshot of a time when anyone can buy/download an app for a single blog, and get all this content beautifully laid out.</p>
<p>So, I contacted Stephen&#8217;s FryPaper person, Andrew Sampson of SamFry about building FryPaper.</p>
<p>Here is that quick interview:</p>
<p><strong><em>Zach</em>: Why make an app for a blog? What does the iPad bring to the table that a browser doesn&#8217;t?</strong></p>
<p><em>Andrew</em>: <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/www.stephenfry.com">Stephenfry.com</a>&#8217;s blog is a very popular website in its own right. We wanted to offer that content in a newspaper format, for free on the iPad. We wanted to show how you could strip back other contend and concentrate on what was popular. Less is more, was our rule. It was a good first stepping stone for our company to develop an iPad App on our own.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zach</em>: What did you have to consider in designing it?</strong></p>
<p><em>Andrew</em>: We considered that the iPad is a new device and that whilst newspapers and magazines are glamouring for it, many would argue that a user interface is yet to be defined. We went for the most elegant and simple user interface we could develop. We also wanted to make sharing it easy. I might add that I don&#8217;t see how magazines and papers will be able to sustain the large multimedia elements of their initial iPad offerings. It&#8217;s brilliant that they did but it cost them a fortune to produce the content, let alone the app itself.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zach</em>: Any major challenges or hurdles?</strong></p>
<p><em>Andrew</em>: Cost. We were very lucky to find a Canadian firm that presented their credentials and production pipeline from the beginning. We&#8217;ve had many false starts on app development in the last year, primarily because of cost. Marco Tabini and his team became SamFry&#8217;s partners for FryPaper.</p>
<p>We were also lucky to secure the sponsorship of G-Technology by Hitachi. This was the first time we&#8217;ve ever had another company believe in what we were doing. They showed extraordinary faith and trust in us, even to the degree of letting us design the sponsorship placements within the app. It only adds up to two ads but boy, it&#8217;s allowed us to fund the FryPaper for iPhone, which is due out in the next few weeks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zach</em>: From your experience, is there any advice you&#8217;d give to someone wanting to build a similar content-focused app?</strong></p>
<p><em>Andrew</em>: Be confident in the depth of your content. Stephen, Nicole, our graphic designer and I, have a strong focus on design. We think content and the user interface synergy is the single most important aspect in delivering electronic content. It harks back to our traditional theatrical beginnings.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zach</em>: Thank you Andrew!</strong></p>

<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged">
<div style="width: 153px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Image:Fulton.jpg"><img title="February 11: Fulton patents steamboat." src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/202px-Fulton.jpg?resize=143%2C204" alt="February 11: Fulton patents steamboat." width="143" height="204" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>
</div>
<p>I have begun to see that we may be entering a new age of polymaths, and I&#8217;m happy to be involved in a part of the business world which seems to sustain some of the best brains on the planet.</p>
<p>I remember reading about the beginners of industry—the pioneers of technology and science. I remember reading how <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Robert_Fulton">Robert Fulton</a> came up against problems in life, and simply invented new ways of doing things, leading eventually to the development of steam-powered paddle-wheel-boats. I remember, vaguely, from my propagandistically pro-industrial schooling that as a child, Fulton had invented or improved on the lead pencil, because the one he was using in school wasn&#8217;t up to scratch. The same story is reflected through many of the West&#8217;s inventors of what we&#8217;ve retrospectively come to call <a class="zem_slink" title="Industrial Revolution" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Industrial_Revolution">the Industrial Revolution</a>: when opportunity or difficulty forced their hands, they changed the situation.</p>
<p>Now, aside from natural romanticism, I like to look to the past with neither rose-tinted glasses nor &#8220;isn&#8217;t-everything-better-now&#8221; short-sightedness. I&#8217;m sure that for every changer, there were crowds of followers in every age, and I&#8217;m sure many of you could point easily to both an earth-changer and a follower without too much effort. Besides, history pays scant attention to followers.</p>
<p>No, what I&#8217;m talking about is the seeming ease with which many of my colleagues in the web industry switch between impressively diverse tasks. Some I know make impressive presenters, and happen to hold PhD&#8217;s in fields more or less unrelated to what they do now&#8230; and can code Java and know a bit of <a class="zem_slink" title="Cascading Style Sheets" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> on the side. I fear to challenge any to play chess (since I haven&#8217;t played in over 5 years, and have the patience of a twelve-year-old), and several are rumoured to be better-than-average musicians. This diversified excellence, alongside the startups, ideas, enthusiastic organisations and programmes i&#8217;ve seen recently, remind me of the society-changers of a century and more ago. Not since then, I think, has such an importance been placed on ambition within social responsibilities.</p>
<div class="alignright"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NgSRwOZtDQ8&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/NgSRwOZtDQ8&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
<p>One of the things I&#8217;ve seen most recently has been the Google 10^100 (apparently pronounced: ten to the one-hundredth with a typically geeky need to explain the pun) which aims to &#8220;help as many people as we can&#8221; by contributing $10million to fund earth-changing ideas. Their site is, in classic Google fashion, very straightforward, so I won&#8217;t repeat their blurb&#8230;just go have a read. But, while you are doing it, I dare you to set aside any cynicism you may harbour either toward a big business, or to any notion of &#8220;changing the world&#8221;. Think about what has and is being done, and then think how you could change the world.</p>

Their list of speakers sounds fantastic, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to meeting some folks in real life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m particularly interested in this conference for its stated focus on the web community. Just have a look at the Agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li> How to grow and nurture your community</li>
<li> Work/life balance or Blood, sweat and tears: Which is the startup way?</li>
<li> Colliding Worlds: Using Jabber to make awesome web sites</li>
<li> Startups live &#8211; An interview with three new European startups</li>
<li> How to survive outside of Silicon Valley</li>
</ul>
<div>Sounds good, doesn&#8217;t it?</div>
<div>There are also &#8220;Networking Opportunities&#8221; there. These sound brilliant despite the rather corporatese description.</div>
<div>They&#8217;ve apparently got seats left, and if you book before 4th August, you save £100.</div>
<div>If you&#8217;re going, let me know—we can meet up. I can tell you a bit about myself and Talis.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/www.kiva.org"></a>It&#8217;s been a few months since I last spoke about Kiva.org, and I wanted to bring it up again. </p>
<p>Since writing, I&#8217;ve tried out the lending scheme, and am blown away with the ability to make a difference to places where it&#8217;s seriously needed. Not only has Kiva created an infrastructure for microlending which makes it incredibly easy to lend small amounts to entrepreneurs in developing countries, but it makes use of the very nature of the Web in connecting you with people all over the world. </p>
<p>The idea of &#8216;sponsorship&#8217; isn&#8217;t really stressed. This isn&#8217;t a: &#8220;For pennies a day, you could clean this water&#8230;&#8221; It&#8217;s much more of a chance to invest directly into the lives of people who need it, and have a chance to pull themselves up. </p>
<p>My primary worry, when lending (giving) is that I&#8217;ll be made to feel like a vouyer in some way. Instead of concern, I worry that I will be made to focus on fascination or curiosity. This doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case with Kiva. Although it doesn&#8217;t feel like a standard business transaction, it does present enough facts in a straight-forward way. There is not over-blown language, but clear presentation of cases.</p>
<p>I also feel more comfortable lending directly to &#8220;partners&#8221; in developing nations. I feel this is much more efficient, and more in the spirit of a digital age. Why would I want to pay the salary of a well-meaning (and not, in any way exploitative) but still Western individual with my giving, when I can invest directly in people already poised to make a difference?</p>
<p>Finally, and possibly most importantly: Kiva doesn&#8217;t take any cut of the loans they provide. Instead, they ask for a separate donation (without any nag or detriment to the service). They don&#8217;t make a big deal of this (rightly), but I feel I should mention it. These people are providing a world-changing service, with few resources, without charging anything for &#8216;upkeep&#8217;. Not only that, but they only ask after you&#8217;ve chosen an amount and a project to support, making it less likely for you to lower your loan amount at that stage to compensate the infrastructure.</p>
<p>To my mind, this is the future of peer-to-peer investment and development. Now, we just need a way to send other resources in a similar infrastructure (education, information, digital resources, experience, and design).</p>
