								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mag3737/224970554/"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 5px" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm1.static.flickr.com/86/224970554_2bed377771_m.jpg?w=1090" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>So, we&#8217;ve been banging on about opening up access to public data for a while. Talis has put its money where its mouth is and <a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/about/">helped to fund</a> the PDDL to give organisations a legal framework for dedicating their data to the public domain. (We&#8217;ll even host open data for free on the Platform under the Connected Commons.) We see the benefits of open data being shared innovation, and many projects exist which make use of this data for <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/greenxchange/">scientific</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog">journalistic</a>, <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">entertaining</a> and just plain <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">useful</a> purposes. We&#8217;ve been seeing a strong trend towards removing siloes and encouraging reuse of information resources to the point that we&#8217;ve begun to create our own jargon around open access. This is great, and even governments are beginning to see the benefit of this with projects like data.gov and Sir Tim Berners-Lee&#8217;s advisory appointment in the UK.</p>
<p>But there is an alternate side to this story of opening up and sharing our data. Where there is open, there is an implied &#8220;closed&#8221; too. Some closed data is absolutely necessary—you wouldn&#8217;t argue that your recent financial transactions are data I should have a right to pry into, for obvious example. There is a lot of hidden data necessary to run applications and to make a profit, and it is entirely right that this should be the case.</p>
<p>But a recent case here in the UK has illustrated the point that if open data encourages innovation, closing down data can quash it. The Royal Mail recently sent cease and desist letters to the directors of ernestmarples.com, who had been providing online services with a set of API&#8217;s to turn UK postcodes into location information. This provision had enabled the building of services which, for example, <a href="http://jobcentreproplus.com/">let people look for jobs in their area</a>, and <a href="http://www.thestraightchoice.org/">monitor and map political leaflet claims</a>. The Royal Mail charges £4000 to make use of its official list of Postcodes, and wasn&#8217;t happy with ernestmarples.org providing postcode data for free. (ernestmarples.com did not license the data, but scraped it from other sites, apparently.) As soon as ernestmarples.com stopped providing the lookup, all the services built on the data were stopped too. So, in effect, the data was enclosed again behind a barrier of a steep paywall and legal action.</p>
<p>There is a lot of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/07/newly-asked-question-royal-mail-postzon">discussion</a> about whether the UK postcode data should be free anyway. It was funded by public funds, for one thing, and it only generates around £11million annually for Royal Mail. The subscription rate is high for startups or non-profits, especially when compared with the Zip-code data in the United States, which I found out only costs $500/year to purchase. {1} It could also be argued that the steep pricing is an archaic throw-back to a time where such services cost a lot to provide, so needed to be high in order to recover costs. But this reverse peppercorn rent could no longer be valid, and £4000 must certainly be an order of magnitude (or two) higher than the cost of provision.</p>
<p>There is a lot to discuss about specific datasets like this, and they may need to be tried legally and publicly before all the details are sorted out, but this case is about as illustrative as possible of the principle of encouraging innovation. A single, simple and non-charging service provided a framework for thousands of users for mostly socially-beneficial aims. Imagine the impact if hundreds of source-services had access to postcode data? Perhaps tens of thousands of users could look for employment, or track their local governmental organisations&#8217; progress. Who knows what else might have been developed? It doesn&#8217;t take a huge leap of imagination to envision services tailored to your very local locality, does it? Just as easily, though, the enclosure of a single database has cut off a huge network of potential innovation.</p>
<p>The Guardian has covered the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/05/ernest-marples-royal-mail-postcodes-legal-threat">story</a>, if you want more details too.</p>

<p>{1} I&#8217;m not entirely sure about the licensing of the Zip-code data, but the representative I spoke with at USPS said you can purchase the 5-digit Zipcode product for $500/a.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p><a class="alignleft" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/l"><img style="margin-right: 5px" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/3029256542_0d6b8871e7_m.jpg?w=1090" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It&#8217;s hardly new for this blog or our community to cover issues of open access and making information useful for users. But, what if we were to begin speaking in terms  such as: &#8220;A call for transparency,&#8221; or subtly replace <em>user</em> with <em>citizen</em>?  With little substantive shift of core meaning, the whole message becomes one of rights, responsibilities, and public duty.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been watching this week as the ember at the heart of this dialogue has been fanned with air-time on mainstream media, and is about to receive its fuel. First, UK Prime Minister Gorden Brown asked Sir Tim Berners-Lee  &#8220;to help us drive the opening up of access to Government data in the web over the coming months&#8221; appointing him to a special role advising Parliament. In an <a title="interview audio" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8096793.stm">interview</a> with BBC tech correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, Sir Tim discussed his position; explaining that he&#8217;s pushing for transparency: &#8220;This is our data. This is our taxpayers&#8217; money which has created this data, so I would like to be able to see it, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Tim had the audience at the <a title="TED Talk, Sir Tim Berners-Lee" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html">tech-friendly TED</a> conference chanting &#8220;Raw Data Now&#8221; back in February, and he&#8217;s now been invited by a sitting government leader to make this happen.</p>
<p>This week also saw the publication of the <a title="Digital Britain PDF—made available via bbc.co.uk" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/16_06_09digitalbritain.pdf">Digital Britain</a> report, outlining Parliament&#8217;s plans for a more connected future. I must admit, for the record, that I haven&#8217;t read all 239 pages of the report (made available via bbc.co.uk), rather, I&#8217;ve skimmed it and read several overviews. The gist seems to be that the UK plans to invest in the future of its citizens&#8217; internet connectivity, upgrading existing infrastructure and providing access where there currently isn&#8217;t. This investment will cover both wired broadband provision (with a stated aim of 2MBps minimum for every household) and wireless, encouraging investment in 3g provision by allowing mobile companies to have their network licenses more permanently.  It recommends subsidising development wherever the market can&#8217;t provide; seemingly equating net access with public utilities (The PM further <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/article6506136.ece">clarified his thought</a>s by saying the Internet is as vital as water or gas). More information on this report can be found on the summary page at the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/digital-britain">Guardian</a>, on twitter: hashtag #digitalbritain, and Bill Thompson&#8217;s tech-centric <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/digital-britain-engaging-with-the-internet">overview</a>.</p>
<p>All this week needs is a major announcement of something moving entirely to cloud-computing to look a bit like the convergence I blogged about a few days ago ;).</p>
<p>So, what has this incredible week brought us? It&#8217;s a governmental lead on opening up access to data. Their appointment of TBL makes me think that it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;ll see more and more linked-data projects coming from the public sector (not just access to, but usable, linked data). Over the next few years, the UK plans to improve its infrastructure and incentivize development on communications networks, and they&#8217;ve begun to use language suggesting that being part of the network and access to Public data are rights issues.</p>
<p>Sir Tim spoke, in the interview, about beginning with low-hanging fruit: pilot schemes which open up data and watch what happens.</p>
<p>What are you building?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p><a class="alignright" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/343290180"><img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 5px" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/343290180_8655cc0b74_m.jpg?w=1090" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The tech world is telling a story about the Web and computing, and the mainstream media seem to be catching on. They&#8217;re hearing about clouds, wikis, and the history of the World-wide Web. The whole thing reads like some sort of legend&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>It was an era, long ago, when the folk of Middle Class plugged in their Mo-Dems and listened to arcane, magical sounds as their £120 beige box enabled a blazing 14.4 kb/s connection, and they only had to wait a few minutes to call forth script and from anywhere on earth. It was an age that saw the beginnings of email, where people composed messages and sent them down the phone lines at lightning speeds (unless a packet dropped&#8230;). This was the time of Web 1.0.</p>
<p>Then, the web collapsed. No one used the internet any more. Modems became paperweights and millions of metres of ethernet cable were grubbed up to make room for under-floor heat in offices. The world was quiet, and the people of Middle Class forgot what they knew.</p>
<p>Until, there dawned the advent of Web 2.0. People re-learned their former ways, and improved upon the innovations of their fathers. Instead of sites and pages, they began to use &#8220;Web Apps&#8221; which accomplished Tasks, and they became their masters. The great titan Google was made, and he knew all and directed the world toward knowledge. The elves of the web taught men the ways of blogging and messenging and eventually (when they&#8217;d mastered all these things with wiki-training to boot) Social Media and Networking.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Only, that&#8217;s not exactly how it happened; is it? Many commentators and Alpha Geeks have divided the story of the web into convenient phases, and they&#8217;ve roughly settled around a versioning metaphor common to software. Have a look at your favorite browser, and you&#8217;ll see a version number (Safari 4 for me, if you&#8217;re interested) which lets you know how many iterations have been and gone before. There are certainly noted differences, and turning points, where people phased out their dependence on one thing for the convenience and utility of something better. Tim O&#8217;Reilly, who coined the phrase Web 2.0, wrote a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/what-is-web-20.html">much-linked post</a> in 2005 trying to explain and crystalise some of the trends he was seeing which were different from the first few years of the web. The fact that he had to clarify what he meant, and that it took the non-geek world three years to catch up testifies to the notion that the change was gradual. It makes me think that we missed out all the .1-.10&#8217;s in the version numbers, and many alpha and beta tests along the way.</p>
<p>Now we are engaged in the great Web 3.0, where we are applying the logic of the past to the present and guessing at the future. Only, because no one is actually releasing versions of the web like a good, reliable software company should, the story is much more complicated—and interesting!</p>
<p>There are notable trends, with backers and bloggers riding various waves. But it seems to me that the point of this is a convergence. The mobile web is bringing new sorts of information to people, and they can make use of this info wherever they happen to be because of advances in devices ad connectivity. As phones and web-enabled devices get better, so to do the chips we seem to have embedded all over the place, and we can now begin to have a more clear picture of what we do through the information we gather from our heaters, cars, and pedometers. Also, as more objects become connected, the grunt-work of number-crunching and storage is becoming commoditized into big, efficient, utility-like cloud services, which host and work with our collected information much more effectively than the gadget in your hand could ever hope to do. Others, like ourselves, talk about the Semantic Web, which allows for an evolution from a bunch of connected documents to the explicit connections between bits of information.</p>
<p>But, I see a trend there which is common to all candidates: information. The web allowed for information to be shared, then collaboratively worked. Now, I see this information becoming useful in and of itself&#8230;as data.</p>
<p>Walt Mossberg <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/welcome-to-web-30">talks about Web 3.0</a> as if it is riding on the backs of mobile and connected devices. And I think it probably is. Tim Berners-Lee recently <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8090538.stm">spoke to the BBC</a> about the future of the web including some incredible future of pixels everywhere, where any surface could display information. He&#8217;s also repeatedly talked about the future of the web being semantic (he invented the term, let&#8217;s not forget) where Linked Data is the web done right. And who am I to argue with the inventor of the Web?</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s so much a conflict or competition as a coming together here. If there will be a Web 3.0 (and it seems a likely, media-friendly label), I think it will include all of these trends centred around the focus of data. The connected devices allow us access to cloud-computing and storage (computing and storage of data&#8230;). Many chips gather data about ourselves, which we can use to personalise our view on the web of data, and the Linking of this data through semantics lets it all be calculable, programmable, and useful. It kind of reminds me of a computer, you know&#8230; The chips and our collective use of web applications are input and sources, and the various devices we use are displays and UI&#8217;s onto a massive, scalable CPU in the cloud. Linked Data could be the Operating System, allowing and enabling anything to be connected and programmed.</p>
<p>Web 3.0, to me, is a convergence of the trends, and it&#8217;s all about data. It&#8217;s not a simple story, and any convenient label is to convenient to be comprehensive, but I&#8217;m pretty sure the next things will all  centre on our ability to make use of and personalise vast chunks of previously-obtuse data.</p>
