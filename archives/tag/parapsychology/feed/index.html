				<description><![CDATA[<p>I don't believe in it. I don't know what I think about the afterlife entirely—it's not something I feel I can know; but everything I have experienced, read and encountered leads me to believe that it's the end of (at least) communication. </p>
<p>I don't believe mediums can communicate with the dead, nor that they can receive information from those who have died. I tend to think of them as either showpeople or charlatans, and feel something beyond skepticism. I think it can be dangerous to make such claims, because it plays on the vulnerable and particularly on vulnerable topics. The loss of someone we know is one of our life-story's saddest parts, and grief often overwhelms judgement: leaving us open to suggestion and trickery.</p>
<p>I think the claim is either nonsensical or despicable, and the people who make it are either vulnerable themselves or preying upon the credulous for control or money.</p>
