								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Friends very often ask whether I feel myself to be American or whether I&#8217;m English yet; and I find I always stammer a bit, and hedge.</p>
<p>Do I feel like an American?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>I spent the first 18 years of my life in Colorado, so you could say I&#8217;m definitely American. But it also means that every post 18-year-old thing I&#8217;ve done has been carried out on foreign soil. My childhood was American: Thanksgiving, baseball, and some kind of vague but persistant instinct to salute and tear up when I hear the Star-Spangled Banner.</p>
<p>But my adulthood has been British: married life, university, career and (the more I think about it) mindset. Even using the word &#8220;foreign&#8221; is difficult: I often think of the US as a foreign country. I say &#8220;we&#8221; when I talk about England playing rugby, but also &#8220;we&#8221; when I think I&#8217;m correcting a misconception about America. I&#8217;ve caught myself saying &#8220;we&#8221; meaning &#8220;Americans&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221; meaning &#8220;Brits&#8221; in the same sentence. I suppose I&#8217;m grateful I don&#8217;t also have to say &#8220;oui&#8221; to include my family name in my confused national identity.</p>
<p>Politically, I seem to see the US as something foreign, something other than mine. And I&#8217;ve felt this recently like no other time while watching stories about the &#8220;Tea Party,&#8221; and the bludgeoning of the American progressive movement at the previous mid-term elections. I supported Obama two years ago almost entirely because I saw him as the best candidate for America&#8217;s perception abroad. Europe does not understand conservative America, it cannot see the charm in folksy anecdotes and it cringes when Sarah Palin speaks. It&#8217;s as foreign to the rest of the world as a pungent delicacy or disinclination to queue. So, regardless of what I may or may not consider to be reasonable US domestic policy, I can see that certain aspects of American culture do not translate well. Obama translates well: his administration simply makes more sense to the rest of the world, while still being hopefully and enthusiastically American.</p>
<p>A conversation on Facebook brought this into focus when a friend asked how America is perceived abroad. I hope that my own position might help others understand both cultures better, but I&#8217;m also more aware than ever that my own perception is confused. I hope what follows might help both of understand America from outside.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important thing to understand about the way the US is understood is that it isn’t, but people feel they do. Through TV, music, film and multi-national organisations (Starbucks, McDonalds, KFC etc), many people in the UK think they are familiar with American culture. This is probably true in reverse: through music, TV formats, film and a vague feeling of historical connection. Through media, ideas like: rich, racially-tense, belligerent, generous, loud, capitalistic, introspective, neurotic, extraverted and untraveled are associated in the British mind with America.</p>
<p>This sense of familiarity can make it difficult to explain that the US is extremely heterogeneous. Its political, racial, cultural, historical and geographic differences would make the average European’s head spin. These are differences a European would experience through travelling across different countries, not through a single nation. It’s hard to express adequately to a British audience how far apart say: Seattle and New Orleans are culturally, or that New York City is hugely different even from the rest of New York State (though this may resonate with London, which is also very different from anywhere outside the M25).</p>
<p>But, there is something about being American, about resonating with a strong national ideal that is certainly seen. The US is paradoxically very American, despite its diversity. There&#8217;s a patriotism and an optimism that is understood but is confusing: it&#8217;s admired and distrusted at the same time.</p>
<p>American foreign affairs have been watched with extreme discomfort and apprehension: the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were extremely controversial in the UK. Tony Blair’s decision to take the UK into combat without the remit of the UN was seen as following too closely in America’s wake. A lot of the satire here from a few years ago featured Tony Blair as a self-conscious lacky to George Bush’s violent and bumbling foreign policy.</p>
<p>Social divisions within the US are noticed but not understood. Coming from a relatively poor part of the US, it’s difficult to hear people talking about rich Americans as if there are no other kinds. I don’t know if this is something that’s completely part of the stereotype, but it&#8217;s probably safe to say that although the US is certainly relatively rich, the difference between rich and poor are huge and not necessarily understood outside the States—or inside, for that matter.</p>
<p>It is probably true that American culture contains something in particular that is difficult for the British to like: it takes itself seriously. I think that Americans generally have a higher opinion of their own culture than the British do of theirs. That’s not to say that Brits aren’t proud to be so, but that they seem to be more tempered and also make light of the foibles they know about. A lot of British humour, for example, is self-deprecating and makes fun of itself for how it must be perceived abroad. Americans more easily default to seeing the rest of the world as foreign, and seeing itself from another perspective is harder. This, even as I type it, brings out another conflict, however. It is probably more true of &#8220;middle America&#8221;—of the South, the MidWest and the Southwest—than it is of the coasts. But, I do think it is broadly applicable to American culture as a whole.</p>
<p>Some truths are better understood, but still only partially: America is seen as not caring about its poor because of its system of non-public healthcare provision and social services. It’s shocking to people that anyone would have to pay for emergency medical treatment, or be saddled with debt through misfortune. The American misunderstanding of socialism is seen as silly: anything socially beneficial is seen in the US almost instantly as socialism (this is something that’s at least true in the conservative parts of the US) and therefore evil. I don&#8217;t think most Americans know the difference between socialism and liberalism or progressivism. It&#8217;s not a distinction I made very well until far more recently than I care to admit.</p>
<p>It’s probably true that the average Brit knows far more about America than the average American knows about just about anywhere else. In a pub this very week, I overheard a conversation which ended with an old standby of fireside bollocks-merchants that happens to be unfortunately true: most Americans don’t have passports. America is introspective, putting America first, and not fully understanding that the rest of the world doesn&#8217;t really see it that way. It&#8217;s probably the case (I don&#8217;t have any statistics to hand) that more Brits have met Americans than Americans have met non-American.</p>
<p>People who travel to the US, or who meet many Americans will be more familiar with the complexity of being American. They may be likely to say that Americans are generous, hospitable, friendly and gregarious, as well as shockingly ignorant of the rest of the world. I have heard some hugely funny stories-one even included me, when one of my relatives asked my wife what language she spoke in London!</p>
<p>British travellers to America often talk about friendly waiters and portion sizes being shockingly huge. On my last trip, after ordering a steak, I tried to work out how they had mistaken my order for a single meal for a request to feed a family of four.</p>
<p>People can only see through the lenses they have access to, I guess, and the things that bring America into focus come through pop music, movies, large companies, TV and news. America cannot be ignored by the rest of the world: it&#8217;s too big and has too much economic influence. So it&#8217;s covered in world news, and it&#8217;s talked about in pubs. I think that through its huge presence, and by travelling more, many Brits probably do understand many of the differences I&#8217;ve outlined above. But I think that even many well-traveled Brits find it hard to see from the perspective of Middle America.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found it helpful writing this, because it&#8217;s shown me something very important about the way I think. I feel American sometimes, and feel familiar with it. But I don&#8217;t feel at home there or with the unqualified label of &#8220;American&#8221;. It&#8217;s very like walking past an old house: you immediately remember what it&#8217;s like to live there, but you don&#8217;t recognise the flowers or the dog. It&#8217;s under new management, and it feels odd to trespass.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>I don't believe in it. I don't know what I think about the afterlife entirely—it's not something I feel I can know; but everything I have experienced, read and encountered leads me to believe that it's the end of (at least) communication. </p>
<p>I don't believe mediums can communicate with the dead, nor that they can receive information from those who have died. I tend to think of them as either showpeople or charlatans, and feel something beyond skepticism. I think it can be dangerous to make such claims, because it plays on the vulnerable and particularly on vulnerable topics. The loss of someone we know is one of our life-story's saddest parts, and grief often overwhelms judgement: leaving us open to suggestion and trickery.</p>
<p>I think the claim is either nonsensical or despicable, and the people who make it are either vulnerable themselves or preying upon the credulous for control or money.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm not entirely sure I understand the question. It's pretty broad. </p>
<p>I think the US has things that make it what it is, some of them good, many poor; but a direct one-for-one swap would not—from my perspective—necessarily bring the benefits they might have in the US. There is, for example, a culture of respect for teachers in the US which I would have liked to have experienced here. Students, still, feel the need to listen to and obey teachers.</p>
<p>However, the things about the society which make this possible are myriad, confusing and far from straightforward. A general respect for authority does, seemingly, exist to a greater extent in the US. But the respect can also manifest as fear, as of police. I instinctively felt fearful around police officers in my home town, probably because I was stopped many times as a teenager for no offense. This has not happened since I moved to the UK, and the culture here seems to be one of the police (generally) respecting citizens.</p>
<p>This, however manifests itself in a state which imposes itself in different, less obvious ways, and a culture in education of active disrespect from students of teachers.</p>
<p>These are gross generalisations, but I think my most basic answer is that the differences are complex, and a simple move from one to the other couldn't work.</p>
<p>Oh, except coffee... there is generally better coffee available in the US. Though, US influence has given some roasters here a good foundation for great beans too.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently asked a very interesting question via <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/zbeauvais">formspring</a>. An anonymous person asked me:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the ability to &#8220;filter&#8221; &#8212; to absorb information from many sources and produce a useful result, quickly &#8212; is what really defines the &#8220;digital native.&#8221; Your thoughts?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Below is my response. I&#8217;d be interested in what you think.</strong></p>
<p>Interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>Ok, so this idea is pretty loaded: it&#8217;s full of meaning. &#8220;digital native&#8221; is a phrase which is semantically rich, and possibly not very precise. It sounds like the kind of topic which could have an entire book&#8217;s worth of words written to describe the meanings.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take one crack at it, though, by using a subject I better understand: linguistics.</p>
<p>In linguistics, we talk about different kinds of language users. Generally, there are native users and non-native, with many exceptions and all sorts of complications when you start looking into the ethnography of the topic. But, essentially, native language users absorb a language through their childhood (the ability to &#8220;acquire&#8221; language in this way seems to disappear around puberty), and they develop a fluency in it. Many linguists believe that this also shapes their thought patterns—i.e.: a native of English <em>thinks</em> in English in some way. Most at least agree that there is also cultural acquisition of some nature too. It&#8217;s all context.</p>
<p>Now, if I don&#8217;t speak a language and I want to learn, I can learn through what many linguists call &#8220;competencies&#8221;. The idea is, very basically, that people think and learn in different ways, so develop different tactics. So, some might have a natural tendency to learn words, grammatical forms and therefore develop strategies which allow them to learn vocabulary. Others use a communicative competency, and learn by trying to communicate rather than learn a form and learn basically through trial and error. (It&#8217;s closely tied with personality: some people are happy to make mistakes verbally, others are more happy to learn on their own etc&#8230;).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going this circuitous route, because I think the way someone learns a non-native language might be a helpful metaphor for the way people work with trends with which they&#8217;re unfamiliar. So, in this metaphor, a &#8220;digital native&#8221; will have the natural acquisition and competencies which come from existing in an online (I assume that&#8217;s at least part of what you mean by &#8220;digital, by the way) world. They&#8217;re used to many sources, ubiquitous connection, visual information on any topic instantly, multi-media content and hardware that&#8217;s actually quite complex to use. The thing is, to a native, it&#8217;s not a very conscious thing. Someone born into an interconnected world would be more frustrated with NOT being able to find out about anything, about not having some form of connection to information and by being unable to understand their hardware. Filtering information is less of a conscious act and more of a subconscious process. They live in a very full world, so they have already developed ways to work with all this information.</p>
<p>You might see more clearly the idea of native and non-native through different competencies, and perhaps whether the way someone thinks and frames their conscious efforts are affected by the presence of connection. Does a &#8220;digital native&#8221; think to try terribly hard to remember someone&#8217;s phone number, working out some sort of pneumonic or rhythm to memorise it? Or would they only have to if their connection were severed?</p>
<p>So, this is a long road to one context in which filtering might be a part of the competency of a &#8220;digital native&#8221;. I don&#8217;t, however, think it&#8217;s definitive; any more than saying someone who can pronounce the &#8220;th&#8221; sound is therefore defined as a &#8220;Native of English&#8221;. There are myriad concepts which are begged to be explored in the idea of being a native anything: context, competencies, aspirations, metaphorical constructs etc etc etc. But, I think the idea that someone born into a community which has lots of information will develop a certain fluency in dealing with it. They might think differently, or simply have had the tools in their &#8220;hands&#8221; for longer—moving from conscious cerebral thought about information to more subconscious, automatic use of digital tools. Filtering, in this construct, is a competency—a skillset and general tendency of a digital world. Natives would be better, non-natives would have to learn by comparing with their own skills and adapting.</p>
<p>But, I think the phrase &#8220;digital native&#8221; could be too full of loosely-encoded meaning to be very precise, or even useful without a wider, shared understanding of what you mean by it.</p>
