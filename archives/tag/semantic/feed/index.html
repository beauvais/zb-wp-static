</div>
<p>I&#8217;m trying out a <a class="zem_slink" title="Zemanta ltd." rel="homepage" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Blog" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Blog">blog post</a>. What it does, apparently, is to suggest ideas for the article you&#8217;re currently writing. It&#8217;s a <a class="zem_slink" title="Semantics" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Semantics">semantic</a> blog <a class="zem_slink" title="Suggestion" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Suggestion">suggestion</a> feature, and it&#8217;s manifested in this instance as a <a class="zem_slink" title="List of Firefox extensions" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/List_of_Firefox_extensions">firefox plugin</a> that adds a write widget to my <a class="zem_slink" title="WordPress" rel="homepage" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wordpress.org">WordPress</a> <a class="zem_slink" title="WYSIWYG" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG editor</a>. IIt updates every 300 characters, and also has &#8216;semantic features&#8217;. There&#8217;s an interview <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/andraz_tori_zemanta_interview.php" target="_blank">over at R/WW</a>, for more information. I&#8217;m kind of trying to see what it recommends so need to fill in the 300 characters:</p>
<div class="zemanta-related">
<p class="zemanta-related-title">Related articles</p>
<ul class="zemanta-article-ul">
<li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a title="Open in new window" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/its-not-just-about-zemanta-but-z-ta-is-cool">It&#8217;s not just about Zemanta (but z-ta is cool)</a> [via Zemanta]</li>
<li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a title="Open in new window" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/?p=80">Rich blog content at the click of a button &#8211; Zemanta has gone live!</a> [via Zemanta]</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>Well it looks like it suggests related articles, and adds a bunch of Zemanta boxes into the blog space. It also finds images from <a class="zem_slink" title="Flickr" rel="homepage" href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>.</p>
<p>I could see this tool being very handy in future, though I usually blog from a client, and I don&#8217;t think this supports ScribeFire or ecto (which is rubbish, by the way.) However, there are a few problems with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>It generates an unhelpful set of areas in the blog itself. So if you include a Zemanta suggestion, it pastes it where you&#8217;re typing, and you end up typing in an alt area in the code&#8230; annoying.</li>
<li>It updates every 300 characters. This is annoying because it&#8217;s not necessarily that real-time. This is an awkward interface feature. It also places your curser at the top of the post every time it updates, meaning what I just <a class="zem_slink" title="Type system" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Type_system">typed</a> appeared above the opening line&#8230;</li>
</ol>
<p>I think this kind of application, however, is prescient of the direction the Read/Write web is heading. It&#8217;s active and dynamic, and I&#8217;m sure the interface will be ironed out over time. I&#8217;m not sure what &#8216;semantic&#8217; features they&#8217;re necessarily incorporating (is this just keyword-searched or is it tyingin with some <a class="zem_slink" title="Resource Description Framework" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a> store somewhere?) but I like the way it&#8217;s heading.</p>
<p>I like the fact that it suggests images (all images in this post provided by Zemanta), but I&#8217;m not sure about the inclusion of &#8216;Zemanta&#8217; presence everywhere&#8230; I&#8217;m also slightly concerned that some of the images it supplies are &#8216;license unknown&#8217;, meaning  you could use one and infringe on copyright. It does, however, have a link saying you can check it yourself, which shows they&#8217;re thinking ahead! It&#8217;s implementation of images is a bit of a struggle, however, in that you end up typing in the description area without the ability to click out of it. This is balanced by the fact that it automatically adds citations. It only adds a single image, though&#8230; so you can&#8217;t add a second image to the same blog post.</p>
<p>Now, they just need to make it a bit smoother, and stop jumping to the top of the bloody post <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p>Last week I listened to a talk by Shane Hipps, a Porsche &#8220;consumer anthropologist&#8221; turned Mennonite minister. The speaker, clearly aware of the contradictory nature of his background, made a very interesting observation about the digital age. He essentially said that we are, as a society, experiencing a shift of great magnitude in history which reflects one of the greatest changes humanity has ever experienced: literacy.</p>
<p>Moving from an oral tradition to a literate society—in which letters allow people to commit their thoughts to memory—fundamentally changed the way society and individuals thought. It freed individuals to think on their own without having to commit their ideas to the collective memory of their tribe. It also changed the ability of the social groups to sense the emotional state of its individuals, because they could now exist in an abstract, individual mindset.</p>
<p>So, agrarian societies relied on the community to remember and structure their ideas. The result of this community conceptual framework was an empathic connection between members of the community. Writing, on the other hand, allows individuals to remove themselves from the older framework and commit their thoughts to paper resulting in a loss or shift in the empathy of the culture or society. In a digital age, however, there is a new shift: one of removal to connection at a distance.</p>
<p>This concept: empathy at a distance or a digitally-connected community, made me consider the connections in the Semantic Web. The in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s of the SemWeb have been argued, discussed, debated, and explored technologically. Many blogs and sites have huge amounts of content devoted to the definitions of SPARQL and RDF. Abstractions have been published discussing the applications of this new technology. Sir Tim Berners-Lee refers to the Semantic Web as &#8216;The Web done right.&#8217;</p>
<p>But, what is being done right? Is the Semantic Web the Web done technologically right? Is it an upgrade to the existing framework or a patch to fix what was wrong? Maybe. But it makes me wonder about looking at this from a sociological or communicative perspective. The Semantic Web, technologically, is important to humanity only so far as it&#8217;s a medium for our connections.</p>
<p>So, when we make new semantic connections, and the software is increasingly able to associate us with concepts, people, items and communities (like academic institutions or or organisations); what is actually happening? People are making connections, and committing them not only to their own memories but to a community.</p>
<p>Publishing, you might argue, has been around since not that long after the first scribblings of meaning. But, publishing is one-way and narrow. A message or idea is only committed to the memories and added to the mental repertories of those who actually read the message. The same is true in a digital age (with multi-channels for &#8216;reading&#8217; such as podcasts and video also) but the distinct difference is the access to concepts and the ease of utilising or &#8216;consuming&#8217; the material. Firstly, digital goods are infinitely (in practice if not in absolute purist terms) copyable. There is no limit to the number of times you can copy and distribute an electronic text or a podcast so society does not have to wait for an idea to filter through because your dad hasn&#8217;t finished their Times crossword. Secondly, the connections made digitally (and more semantically-enriched) are increasingly collaborative. With software doing the heavy lifting in terms of data mining and content distribution, more ideas get to more people in more accessible ways.</p>
<p>Finally, although the Semantic Web is far from complete in application, the glimmers it allows us to see could have huge sociological implications. It&#8217;s the human element of the Semantic Web which makes it so exciting and so potentially disruptive. It&#8217;s possible that people, finding and synthesising ideas before feeding back their individual perspectives into the community, are increasingly able to connect with people and concepts in a more empathic way; without losing the abstract and logical abilities of the literate age.</p>
<p>Is this a new age? Undoubtedly. What will it look like? I&#8217;d say: like you and me—people.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities**</p>
<p>Looking at the world through a closed metaphor, like a walled garden, actually stops you from expanding the scope of possibilities available to the software you develop. This is because closed-world perspectives on data and meaning preclude the ability for further questioning. The answer to the question: &#8220;What don&#8217;t we know yet?&#8221; is not possible to answer. It&#8217;s capped at what you already know. The cause of this limit is the assumption that everything you don’t know is false, and it’s common to most software development.</p>
<p>This is a concept fundamentally at conflict with a &#8216;web&#8217; metaphor or perspective. The idea of networked information (connected, accessible, linkable) could not get very far if the software logic balked at any new data, or any data which didn’t fit its pre-existing definitions.</p>
<p>A well-used example of this is asking a question about a person’s details which the system cannot know. So, if it is known that John is a citizen of the US; and you ask the system: “Is it true that John is a UK citizen?” a closed-world software solution will answer: “No.” However, an open-world perspective cannot definitively answer “no”, because it doesn’t know the answer&#8211;John might, for example, have dual-nationality.</p>
<p>Asking: &#8220;What else is there? Where can I find it? What can I do with it?&#8221; are fundamental to the Semantic Web, and to the way in which we go about creating it. Applications written for a limited data set can only ever answer questions asked about their data. In this sense, the current software development model exists within self-created walled gardens whose perimeters are set by the limit of software’s inquisitiveness.</p>
<p>Opening-up the limits could lead to a fundamental shift in metaphor for software. At the moment, all software agents are called ‘applications’. They ‘apply’ a logic to a set of data and spit out an answer. We think of them as automated beings like robots. They live in a world of data and work with what you feed them.</p>
<p>Perhaps if we move more toward a metaphor of a ‘perspective’, the open data web will begin to make more sense. Instead of designing robots to do tasks with your data, engineers can begin creating views on the data. Essentially, instead of designing, using and selling a robot to do something, they’d be creating, utilizing, and selling their perspective. Software would create a contextualized view on the data. It can manipulate the results by re-focusing the context and by including other aspects from other datasets into its calculations, but it doesn’t forget that the data it is using exists outside it’s computations.</p>
<p>Imagine opening up your laptop and clicking on the ‘perspectives’ folder to open up a PIM (Personal Information Manager like thunderbird or outlook). This PIM Perspective can look at the data about you, and apply a context to it. Allows you to view the data from a particular perspective. Finding the answer to ‘Am I free on Tuesday?” becomes a matter of ‘viewing’ the available information about your schedule on Tuesday within the context of events you have accepted to attend. This ‘view’ could then be further contextualized by adding further aspects to the Perspective: location/travel time, likelihood of proceeding events running over etc&#8230; Each aspect determines the ultimate view you have on the data for ‘Tuesday’. Instead of applying one bit of data (an event) on another bit of data (a date) and seeing if the data conflict, you get to ‘see’ the answer to your questions using existing data. The openness in this metaphor could include the fact that the data for an event lies outside the application’s resources. Say the event is a meeting organized by a company. If the company has published the event data, your PIM Application needs to import this information (you can either enter it, or accept an invitation) before adding it to its calculations. What then happens if the company cancels or moves the event location or meeting time? They have to re-send the information to all the attendees, who then have to modify their PIMs’ data. In an open-world, the data exists outside the PIM, so if the published information changes, the PIM’s Perspective changes accordingly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tend to live in a world of metaphor. It&#8217;s not my fault, according to Lakoff and Johnson. We all use metaphor all the time: to construct our thoughts and work out abstract concepts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been exploring this a bit in the context of the Semantic Web over on Nodalities. Please feel free to have a look and send me some feedback on what you think about this set of ideas.</p>

If you don&#8217;t believe me, go ahead and poll your office or family: unless you&#8217;re not allowed out of the IT dungeon or your family all work as tech-bloggers, my guess is that they haven&#8217;t heard or don&#8217;t understand the term.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really surprising. If you hear about a &#8220;new internet phenomenon&#8221; on mainstream news, the chances are it&#8217;s either on it&#8217;s way out or is so firmly entrenched as to be unremarkable. For a perfect example of this, look up &#8216;Facebook&#8217; in a national publication and note the language used to describe it&#8217;s shiny-new cover&#8211;regardless of the fact that most people reading this blog will have been on Facebook (or gone off Facebook) at least a year ago!</p>
<p>It even now seems that there may be a financial impact on describing your new startup as &#8220;web 2.0&#8221;. According to <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/in-case-you-missed-it-web-20-is-bad-now">Mashable!</a>, several VC&#8217;s are stating quite clearly that they won&#8217;t back Web 2.0. I have also noticed talk of bubbles breaking and &#8216;meteoric rises&#8217; with the implication that it won&#8217;t last very much longer. So many potential break-throughs won&#8217;t see their funding if they&#8217;re too 2.0.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is firmly entrenched in &#8216;techy&#8217; social networks like Digg. When I dugg a news story about the semantic web, I noticed the overwhelming majority of comments were along the lines of &#8220;semantic web is so cliche&#8221;, or &#8220;Watch out, here comes Semantic Web 2.0, Run!&#8221;. Semantic web is a term which has only been widely used recently (relative to &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; which was popularised by web stalwart <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/what-is-web-20.html">O&#8217;Reilly</a> Way back in 2005) and is already met with derision and sarcastic scorn.</p>
<p>To some extent, I think this is a good thing. If VC&#8217;s and financial backers are waking up to this, it means there might be more competition for funding and an increase in the quality of online startups. It might also mean some updates and refreshing of already-started-ups. While techy scorn is easy to find and probably doesn&#8217;t mean too much, the reality behind the bluster might just be the next set of updates to real users&#8217; online experiences. Oh, and don&#8217;t try calling it &#8220;Web 3.0&#8221;. Just don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no pleasing everyone, but it seems to me that Web 2.0 is a phenomenon which, if you&#8217;re not already using it on a daily basis (on Facebook, following Twitter, using Gmail), it&#8217;s probably better not to talk about it. Webby people will start to question your breeding and choice of apparel!</p>
