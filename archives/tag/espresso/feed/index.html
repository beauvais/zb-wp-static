I&#8217;m geeky enough to know what a PID controller is, and why that&#8217;s something £5k+ professional machines tend to have under their shiny bonnets. When a friend sent me a link to their Kickstarter project, I quickly joined the—now immense—throng of backers. Following their webby approach to design and engagement, their startup-mentality, and the ultimate goal of bring professional-grade espresso home, the Nocturn sits soundly on the girders of my writing interests.</p>
<p>The ZPM team were happy to answer some questions I had for them, and ended up telling me a very compelling story, which I&#8217;d like to share with you.</p>
<p><strong>1. I understand the Nocturn to be distinctly different from most other home espresso machines. Where do these differences lie, and what makes these important?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s first important to know that there&#8217;s been very little advancement in the way of manual and semi-automatic espresso machines—especially in home machines—since the first pump-driven E61 machine was introduced in 1961. Huge commercial machines have been refined to provide more temperature stability and pressure consistency, but home machines never really caught up despite a growing community of at-home espresso lovers and increases in our knowledge of what you need to make good espresso.</p>
<p>Even without major modifications in design, home machines that make solid espresso are really expensive. And that&#8217;s what really got us thinking about the problem. We were college students; we loved espresso; but we couldn&#8217;t afford a $1000+ home machine that would make truly good, reliable espresso. We could, however, buy a bunch of (very) used espresso machines off of Craigslist, tear them apart, see what made them tick, then Frankenstein them back together to try to make one that worked better. It started to look like we could do a better job for less.</p>
<p>We approached it as an engineering problem, not a coffee problem. What do you need to make great espresso? Tightly regulated temperature and pressure. Well, gee, we could do that.</p>
<p>The major innovations were replacing the mechanical controls typically used with digital controls, and controlling everything digitally with a native PID control loop. Once you had that in place, you didn&#8217;t need to rely on a huge hunk of expensive metal for your thermal stability, you could use a much less expensive aluminum thermoblock, and it would actually perform better because you could implement controlled temperature changes over the course of a shot, and your brew water volume wasn&#8217;t limited to the preheated boiler water.</p>
<p>In the past, thermoblocks have been the mark of a cheap machine, but by redesigning the block to improve its thermal properties, and improving the control mechanism, we&#8217;ve been able to make our block outperform home boiler machines. We&#8217;ve also implemented a pump control mechanism that provides the first-ever pressure control system in a home machine, which contributes to the shot repeatability.</p>
<p>Espresso is a game of controlling and manipulating variables, and we&#8217;ve just done that better than anyone else in our price range.</p>
<p><strong>2. With all of these differences, for what kinds of home brewers is the Nocturn designed?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9612_kgmzua.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10095" data-permalink="https://beggingaquestion.com/archives/kickstarter-zpm-espresso-nocturn/img_9612/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9612_kgmzua.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2048,1365" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XTi&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1361384959&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;70&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;800&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="IMG_9612" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9612_kgmzua.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9612_kgmzua.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10095" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9612_kgmzua-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="IMG_9612" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9612_kgmzua.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9612_kgmzua.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9612_kgmzua.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9612_kgmzua.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9612_kgmzua.jpg?resize=1090%2C727&amp;ssl=1 1090w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>We&#8217;d like to think it&#8217;s designed for everyone. Our goal was to make a machine that produces truly exceptional espresso—the kind you get with thousands of dollars of investment in a home brew setup—and make it at a price point that is as attractive as possible.</p>
<p>We also know that espresso can be kind of intimidating to a lot of people. We hated the idea that people might be put off getting into the whole culture of making and exploring espresso because they were scared of messing up or didn&#8217;t want to invest in an expensive setup only to find that it wasn&#8217;t for them.</p>
<p>One of the core guiding requirements of the design has been that you have to be able to unpack it from the box, turn it on, press one button and make some decent coffee.</p>
<p>The addition of a full-color LCD and intuitive GUI also enables users to easily adjust temperature and pressure settings which, historically could require breaking open the machine and manipulating a mechanical check valve to change pressure! The screen was a response to the fact that we had a ton of backers who were choosing the Nocturn to be their very first home machine. We wanted to do our best to combine ease-of-use with complex features—after all, we didn&#8217;t make all of this variable control so people could just pull shots at 95˚C and 9 Bar for the rest of their lives!</p>
<p>Ideally, our machine is straightforward enough for the beginner, but offers the complex features that will allow an expert home barista to play around with. So many other machines in this price point are meant to be &#8216;starter&#8217; machines, with the expectation that you&#8217;ll eventually want to upgrade to something more expensive. We think this machine has everything you need to fully explore your coffee. At the same time, it&#8217;s a great learning tool because of the consistency—it&#8217;s very hard to improve your technique when you have no idea whether the problem is you or the machine.</p>
<p><strong>3. So, tell me about Kickstarter: what lead you to decide on funding the Nocturn&#8217;s development through online startup backing?</strong></p>
<p>It was mostly serendipity. We were getting to a point where we thought we had a design that could really change the market, but it was starting to cost too much for us to keep pursuing on our own without knowing whether anyone else shared our interest.</p>
<p>Kickstarter was kind of ideal for us in that the all-or-nothing funding model provided the proving ground we needed. We knew how much capital we needed to do a very small beta run of hand-built machines based on our core design. Either we&#8217;d make that amount and move forward, or we wouldn&#8217;t and we could stop wasting our time.</p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t originally expecting to raise anywhere near what our funding total ended up being. The original expectations was just that we&#8217;d be able to fund a lease on the necessary equipment.</p>
<p><strong>4. How have you found the process of funding and developing in full view of your potential market?</strong></p>
<p>I think the most interesting thing has been the way that crowdfunding throws the typical product development process on its head. Normally you have to do rounds of funding, build a company, do tons of marketing, and build an ad campaign before you introduce yourself to your market. That process has a certain structure and familiarity to it, but it also has a pretty high entry barrier for teams like ours—and others who turn to crowdfunding.</p>
<p>That said, the price you pay is this: rather than experiencing all the growing pains of a project like this behind closed doors, you&#8217;re all of a sudden accountable to a big group of people who&#8217;ve backed you and are now expecting delivery. Recently there have been a bunch of stories relating to how this stress is starting to get to a handful of project creators who had wildly successful projects, but found themselves struggling with different aspects of their projects—not just with completion, but with the emotional stress that a big group of angry backers can apply. Normally you have a customer service buffer between the engineer or artist who created something and the customers that might complain about it. With Kickstarter, because the teams are usually just a few people, all of that internet trollery can really start to wear on you, especially when you&#8217;re already losing sleep over a project that you&#8217;ve put your heart and soul into.</p>
<p>I think that, a year ago when we started the project, Kickstarter was blowing up and everyone was having the problem of ensuring that people understood the &#8220;Kickstarter is not a store&#8221; idea, which created a lot of anger on the part of confused backers, and stress for the creators of really popular projects.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been really lucky to have a group of backers who have been exceptionally supportive and patient throughout the whole process. We&#8217;ve done our very best to be completely transparent whenever we experience setbacks, both in our updates and in individual correspondence (as anyone who has dared to send us an email probably knows, I can be obnoxiously verbose). We&#8217;ve tried to get backers in on the incredibly complex process of manufacturing a consumer product, and we think that&#8217;s part of the fun of backing projects &#8211; what challenges will you face, and how will you overcome them?</p>
<p>Hopefully the result is that people feel an emotional connection to the product they helped create, and walk away with a better understanding of how this type of thing gets made.</p>
<p><strong>5. Have you any advice for other startups?</strong></p>
<p>Ha! Celebrate the little victories. Our problem (and I think a common one) has been that we&#8217;ve had a lot of setbacks, and they can start to make you feel so down that you forget why you set out on this crazy adventure in the first place.</p>
<p>We have a working machine now. It still has some kinks to be worked out, but we made cappuccinos this morning. That&#8217;s exciting!</p>
<p>Some advice we got after we&#8217;d already been funded: &#8220;Take the timeline that your engineer gives you and triple it.&#8221; We thought, &#8220;Not us, not our engineer…&#8221; We all know how that turned out.</p>
<p>No matter the project, take your timeline and triple it.</p>
<p><strong>6. Back to coffee, what was the last coffee you brewed at home?</strong></p>
<p>Since we just took a trip to Batdorf &amp; Bronson to do a machine demo, we&#8217;re loaded up on their beans right now. I think this morning we brewed the B&amp;B Dancing Goats.</p>
<p><strong>7. OK, tell me: how good is the coffee from the Nocturn? Be honest…</strong></p>
<p>When we demoed the machine at Batdorf the other day, the response we were getting was that the shots we were getting where on par with their PID&#8217;d La Marzocco Linea (a $12,000 commercial machine), and that it was hands-down the best home machine they&#8217;d ever used. And this coming from people who know their stuff when it comes to coffee.</p>
<p><strong>8. Finally, have you any new projects on the horizon for ZPM?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a few ideas in mind. Our machine offers significantly more value than anything on the market with the same quality and features, but we&#8217;d like to work on another model that&#8217;s even more affordable &#8211; by making some key design modifications (like replacing the steel shell with plastic and eliminating the screen) &#8211; basically taking away anything that&#8217;s not directly involved in making great espresso. The accessibility of great espresso is a really important part of this project to us, and we think we can still push further on that front.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also working on a model that can do simultaneous steam and brew—as that&#8217;s probably the most common request we&#8217;ve gotten since the campaign.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also got a dozen ideas for little coffee-related gadgets that need to be worked through.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Fool&#8217;s Gold</h2>
<p>As a child in Colorado, I have a distant memory of finding a nugget of pure gold, bigger than the tip of my thumb. I instantly became the richest kid in America! I thought I could buy a husky (with a sled) and a Tama Starclassic Birch studio set with a full range of Paiste cymbals, and maybe a house or three. I could move out on my own, I could—so many expectations; so many promises.</p>
<p>My dad took a quick look and said something like: &#8220;Wow, you&#8217;ve found iron pyrite. Fools Gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>The disappointment! All those things to which I was looking forward disappeared, and the lump of cold angles suddenly seemed a reminder of what could have been.</p>
<p>I have recently had a similar experience with some fools coffee.</p>
<h2>Coffee Suppositories?</h2>
<p>I was asked by <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/www.miele.com">Miele</a> to trial a high-end coffee machine for three weeks, and give an honest account of what I found. I was thrilled, since the last time I got to play with a 5-figure espresso machine was during uni working as a barista. I built up a few images in my mind; imagining pulling perfect shots of central-american Cup of Excellence blends, practising my crema, and tasting half a dozen different coffees to see which worked best with the £1,000 set up. My interest was only piqued further when a colleague at work described Miele as &#8220;the Rolls Royce of appliances&#8221;.</p>
<p><a class="lightview" href="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/3410528538_67355752d7_m.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="undrinkable" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/3410528538_67355752d7_m.jpg?resize=180%2C240" alt="" width="180" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>About three weeks ago, a courier arrived as I sat working from my home office. He delivered a box big enough for a springer spaniel to sleep in, and heavy enough to make the manly nonchalance I affected while carrying it away from the door quite difficult indeed. Nonetheless, I left the box packaged and wrapped up in the hall until the evening, looking forward to the reward of an espresso or six after work.</p>
<p>As I worked my way through the layers of packaging, I gradually unveiled a stainless-steel, microwave-like appliance that dwarfed anything else my kitchen held, except—just—the oven. I scanned the quick-start guide and with a single word, my expectations instantly disappeared: &#8220;nespresso&#8221;. I lost the will even to unpack and set up this monstrously-large contraption.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I did set it up, removing all of a counter-top from usable space. My disappointment, if anything, grew as I laboriously set up the menu through an achingly-complicated process involving the use of arrow buttons and &#8220;OK&#8221; to calibrate a dizzying array of possible settings. Throughout the next two hours, I played with settings, opened all the openable compartments and tried several of the coffee suppositories. My thoughts follow:</p>
<p>The Miele CVA3650 is a giant appliance which costs £1,000 (c. $1400). It looks impressive, with a stainless-steel finish and various accoutrements, including backlighting, obviously included as talking features. It would not feel out of place in a posh flat in Kensington—fitting in like an addition to a designed suite of expensive appliances. Indeed, the lasting impression is of a lifestyle rather than coffee. <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/features.aspx?pid=687">Browsing the Miele site</a>, I found many photos of kitchens, appliances, and artfully-arranged mugs sometimes held by comfortable, rich-looking models. The only thing missing from these photos?</p>
<p><a class="lightview" href="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/3468637867_97933db093_m.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="fools gold" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/3468637867_97933db093_m.jpg?resize=180%2C240" alt="" width="180" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Coffee.</p>
<p>Nespresso tastes worse than I thought it actually could. I&#8217;m not saying that to be snobbish about my coffee, and I was genuinely curious to know what the little, coloured &#8220;pods&#8221; could produce. The result of every single &#8220;brew&#8221; was a flat, metallic, suspension of frankly disgusting, tepid liquid. Some aspect of the extraction produces an interestingly-contrived crema every single time, so the drink (I can&#8217;t call it coffee) certainly looks impressive. My wife recoiled after the first sip, and I left more than one completely untouched. The terrible &#8220;flavia&#8221; machine in my office makes better-tasting coffee than this!</p>
<p>The Miele machine is touch-button automation at it&#8217;s most falsely economic (time-wise). Sure, it&#8217;s convenient to press a button and have an espresso (ahem!) within 30 seconds, but that does not account for the half-hour (no joke) of programming every time the machine is re-plugged back in. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m green-conscious enough to flip the switch at the wall after every brew, so this makes it ridiculous to use. The menuing system is cumbersome enough to make my eyes water. Two arrows, and &#8220;OK&#8221; to make every selection. It takes a huge amount of patience, and its&#8230; just&#8230; aweful! So many features, so few necessary or even useful. You can, for example, programme 9 different &#8220;user profiles&#8221;. Why? It&#8217;s a pod of shite coffee, which will taste EXACTLY the same, no matter which button you push. Why go through dozens and dozens of beeps in order to have a user-specific nescafe?</p>
<p>The only part of this machine which is convenient, is the actual making of a drink. For that, it is fast! It produces a <del datetime="2009-04-23T22:23:17+00:00">coffee</del> of your choice (out of 5 different capsules) very rapidly (provided it&#8217;s been programmed and has already been switched on, obviously.) It will then automatically rinse itself, and let you make another soil infusion very rapidly. You only have to remove the spent capsules periodically from a tub within the machine, and fill up a water reservoir whenever it&#8217;s low (though, this is fairly frequently, thanks to the rinsing).</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Before writing this post, I sent Miele&#8217;s representatives a quick heads&#8217; up, with a brief summary which I think works well.</p>
<blockquote><p>I understand its premise of being a super-convenient means of having a sophisticated-looking hot beverage, but I much prefer my coffee to be tasty, regardless of time. And the amount of time spent scrolling endlessly through menus isn&#8217;t really conducive to suiting busy people like myself as a domestic coffee machine. <em>[in reply to the statement that it might prove to be]</em> I&#8217;d be much more likely to advise people invest in a cafetiere, grinder and decent beans. For the £1,000 they could have spent on this, they could have many scores of kilos of excellent, locally-roasted, hand-sourced beans, and enough left over to send a thank-you bottle of single malt to the coffee roaster.</p></blockquote>

<p>The British have a strange relationship with coffee. On one hand, they have an overwhelming love for hot beverages. Only here will you be offered a cuppa during a break from gardening in hot sunshine. You will have a hot drink during family visits, dinner parties, and any time when it is not virtually impossible to hold a mug. All in all, this is fantastic. I happily join the gathering round the kettle when it&#8217;s less than boiling outside. I tend to ask for tea, because British coffee is usually instant.</p>
<p>The other side of British coffee is the British Imported Coffee Culture (BICC). BICC can be found in high-street chain shops. each takes an ever-so-slightly different angle on Seattle/Italian café chic. Most of the coffee from these shops seems to come from the same bean and machine combination. The atmosphere is identical, with a dominant shade of maroon, brown, blue or green making the walls the only distinguishing mark. To the consternation of Brits the country over, each has its own opaque size system, designed to confuse and belittle the customer who inevitably ends up asking: &#8220;But, which is the <em>small</em> one?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as if the BICC cartel, gathered at some point in the early 2000&#8217;s and set down some industry guidelines on preparing British coffee.</p>
<p><strong>First,</strong> because the British palette has been evolved around the flavours of milky tea and biscuits, BICC beverages must avoid shocking customers. Aim to be essentially flavourless. Any foreign smart-arses asking for espresso will be greeted with a small glass of burnt tea leaves suspended in hot dishwater.<br />
<strong>Second</strong>, all baked goods (which are mandatory at a proper British coffee house) shall be supplied from a limited BICC-approved list of bakeries. Pastries shall be huge, greasy muffins and strangely contrived cake combinations like apricot and prune biscotti brownies. The more creative and unlikely combinations will be considered for annual prizes.<br />
<strong>Third</strong>: wherever possible, a smattering of faux-Italiano shall be displayed and worked into the jargon of serving staff (i.e. baristas), to cover any coffee blunders with embarrassing cultural ambiguity.<br />
<strong>Finally,</strong> because this is all imported and frightfully expensive-sounding, we shall be setting the prices for beverages, baked goods, and sandwiches at just below the cost of the weekly shopping. The business logic for this last point, as you can see from the infographic, is that aspiring people will gladly pay extortionate cultural tariffs to appear coffee-literate.</p>
<p>Thus it was that the executive classes of Britain were won over to incredibly expensive milk, with the small addition of highly-addictive coffee made with impressive-looking but fully-automatic espresso machine monsters.</p>
<p>Not happy with their strangle-hold on Britain&#8217;s purchasers of pin-stripes, however, British Coffee Culture soon began infiltrating more reputable establishments. I know that the transformation of Imported Coffee Culture is more or less complete, now. I was recently offered a &#8220;mochacino-latte&#8221; at a seaside chip shop. (After seeing the BICC-branded instant beverage machine behind the counter littered with polystyrene cups and a suspicious powder, I declined). These shops and places of amusement have opted for a lighter touch, however, and have begun simply calling it &#8220;froffee coffee&#8221;. The froffee coffee is a uniquely British coffee-like drink made mainly from powdered milk sprayed through a plastic nozzle into a brown concentrate. The resulting chemical reactions produce a strangely petroleum-flavoured foam atop an instant-coffee. If you&#8217;d like to make it a &#8220;somethingcino&#8221;, you simply add a few tablespoons of powdered drinking chocolate to the foam, cup, napkin and surrounding customers.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, most Brits are still impressed by a cafetière, or anything which can be labelled &#8220;proper coffee&#8221;. Proper coffee, like the froffee coffee, is a British sobriquet for any coffee not made by adding boiling water to brown granules. I suspect that in some households, the granules placed in a coffee pot rather than directly into a mug qualify as proper.</p>
<h2>Making proper, British coffee</h2>
<p>I have decided, as a public service, to challenge the BICC, the Froffee Coffee and the proper coffee by outlining a few simple ways to experience bliss.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beans</li>
<li>Grinder</li>
<li>Cafetière/coffee press</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s dead simple, really. Buy some beans, and don&#8217;t cry when you pay for them. A bag of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/www.unionroasted.com">British</a>&#8211;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/www.hasbean.co.uk">roasted </a>beans will set you back about the same as a single, higher-priced drink at your local BICC establishment.</p>
<p>Buy a coffee grinder. I&#8217;ve encountered the myth that grinders are incredibly expensive. I think the only power behind this is that no one seems to own one, making them seem rare and exclusive: <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=kitchen&amp;amp;qid=1223235555&amp;amp;sr=8-1">here&#8217;s one for just over a tenner</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, a cafetière, or coffee-press. As my family in the US calls them: French Press – possibly now the &#8220;Freedom Press, but I can&#8217;t be sure because I don&#8217;t watch Fox News.</p>
<p>Grind the fresh beans (don&#8217;t keep them longer than a fortnight) until they&#8217;re coarsely ground. The grounds should look like sand, not flour. Boil the kettle, and pour a bit into the cafetière to warm it up. Pour this out and add the grounds. You&#8217;ll want 4-6 good-sized tablespoonfuls of grounds for a four-cup press. Add the off-boil water and stir it so all the beans are nicely wet. Put the lid on, and wait 4 minutes. Plunge and serve.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it. Proper coffee that tastes wonderful.</p>
