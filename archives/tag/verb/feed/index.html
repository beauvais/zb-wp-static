								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing a word with extra syllables seems like a kind of one-upmanship over drab, simpler words like: <em>use</em>; and <em>do</em>. Is this a form of snobbery even more unbecoming than non-standard, corporate English?</p>
<p>Such marked words display a kind of vanity that doesn&#8217;t add much value. Let&#8217;s look at <em>utilise</em>. Taking the definitions from <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/utilise">Wictionery</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Verb</p>
<p>utilise (third-person singular simple present &gt; utilises, present participle utilising, simple past and past participle utilised)</p>
<p>To make useful, to find a practical use for.</p>
<p>To make use of; to use.</p>
<p>To make best use of; to use to its fullest extent, potential, or ability.</p>
<p>To make do with; to use in manner different from that originally intended</p></blockquote>
<p>Each definition here makes use of a particularly useful word in defining <em>utilise</em>: use.</p>
<p>No matter which way you look at it, utilising something means using it. So, in what way is it more preferable to <em>utilise</em> something, than to <em>use</em> it?</p>
<p><em>Utilise</em> does bring to mind more than just &#8220;use,&#8221; but does it improve the meaning being conveyed? I think the extra little syllables draw attention to the word itself: <strong>highlighting</strong> it within your other words. I am surely guilty of choosing gilt words which draw the mind to them, but I do hope they at least make sense on their pedestals. Does it make sense to highlight the word &#8220;use&#8221; in a sentence?</p>
<p>&#8220;Our service <strong><em>utilises</em></strong> this new technology!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it usually be more appropriate to draw attention either to your service, or to its new technological wizardry?</p>
<p>A simpler, bolder:</p>
<p>&#8220;We use this new technology&#8221;</p>
<p>seems to emphasise the active nature of the statement by making the agent personal (<em>we</em> instead of <em>our service</em>), and naturally points toward the new technology.</p>
<p>I suppose utilising feels less active than using. If I use a stick to bash your car, the emphasis is on me, and my action of bashing with a stick. If I were to utilise a stick, it feels like I had less choice in the matter of bashing your car, and more in choosing my implement. It&#8217;s along a similar vein to choosing the passive over the active voice: your car was bashed, and I&#8217;m too ashamed to admit to being the basher.</p>
<p><em>Leverage</em> and <em>action</em> follow utilise. Attacking the verb leverage has added pedantry points because that final bit at the end (the morpheme &#8220;-age&#8221;) changes a verb into a noun in English. For example, I might spill this beer and create spillage, I have never yet spillaged anything. I will leave leverage here, but you can read more about it in Gabriel Smy&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://this.isfluent.com/blog/2010/are-you-stupid-enough-to-use-leverage-as-a-verb">Are you stupid enough to use leverage as a verb</a>?&#8221;</p>
<p>To <em>action</em> something, makes my mind contort into funny shapes trying to follow the logic. It follows <em>utilise</em> in its attention-seeking added emphasis, but it also feels like a completely wrong-fit for any sentence. Here&#8217;s how it goes for me:</p>
<p>Generally, language works in terms of agents, actions and objects. &#8220;I do a task&#8221; is a simple sentence in which I&#8217;m the thing performing an action on an object. Using the word &#8220;action&#8221; (which is a noun meaning &#8220;to act&#8221;), makes me wonder exactly how I&#8217;m supposed to act out the action of actioning something. If it&#8217;s a task, I could perform other actions on it (complete, delegate, begin, ignore&#8230;), but what action does &#8220;to action&#8221; imply? I&#8217;d rather just do tasks and save the mental gymnastics of attempting actively to undertake an action by actioning them. I&#8217;m sure someone better at logical reasoning than I could find a way around it, but they won&#8217;t alleviate the headache.</p>
<p>There is more &#8220;corporate jargon&#8221; out there (misuse of reflexive pronouns, &#8220;going forward&#8221;, &#8220;solutions&#8221;&#8230; <em>ad nauseam</em>), and no doubt other writers are actioning a list of words to attack, leveraging additional words and utilising blogs, tweets, and postings, so what is one more?</p>
<p>Well, I hope it&#8217;s shown that there are real reasons for some of us not liking the words some others choose, and to poke around a tiny bit into the details. An entire book could be written on this, and I&#8217;m sure it could be done without being bullying or entirely pedantic, but I&#8217;ve got to go now and find something to mop up the beer I just spillaged.</p>
