								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have come to the conclusion, after being without a car for five years, that travel by rail in the UK is just about the most infuriating process you can undertake on a regular basis. Every day, one of my 6 train journeys to or from work will fail in some way or other. Either there will be a delay, a last-minute platform change, a cancellation&#8230; something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Looking at the complexity of the rail network, it&#8217;s not surprising that it doesn&#8217;t always run exactly right. However, since I can pretty much guarantee that my train journey to work or back will be compromised in some way, I&#8217;m starting to wonder. There is no &#8216;normal&#8217; service, you see. It&#8217;s a myth that the trains usually make it on time. Perhaps it is more than 50% of each leg of any given journey&#8230; maybe. But at some stage in every multi-sectioned journey I&#8217;ve had, some aspect of the trip fails.</p>
<p>II&#8217;m beginning to wonder what could possibly fix this situation. I&#8217;m told daily by an electronic voice: &#8220;I&#8217;m extremely sorry for the severe delay to this service.&#8221; I wonder what rail executives hope to achieve by creating an automated apology system? It&#8217;s not exactly like it&#8217;s a good value for money trade-off either. Train travel is bloody expensive, and it doesn&#8217;t work the majority of the time.</p>
<p>Maybe executive heads need to roll, maybe a huge infusion of public money needs injecting into the system, maybe&#8230; they need a change of perspective. If they measure every individual step in a day, they might come to the conclusion that they&#8217;ve failed n number of times. n=number of delayed, cancelled or otherwise compromised phases of transit between any two given points on the network. However, if X represents the full journey of an individual in a sampled population, and X is made up of a number of phases, I wonder how many X&#8217;s would end up compromised in some way?</p>
<p>Sample 100 complete journeys across the entire network. Each journey is an individual X (complete from point A to B with each stop and change included). Each completed leg of any given X could be designated y, and any compromised legs (including additionally-accrued attrition from one failed leg compromising another) could be w&#8217;s.</p>
<p>There are two numbers I&#8217;d be interested in seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ratio of y&#8217;s to w&#8217;s across the sampled population&#8217;s collective X&#8217;s</li>
<li>The number of X&#8217;s which contain at least one w</li>
</ul>
<p>I reckon and predict, that these numbers would reflect very unfavorably on the network&#8217;s ability to run itself.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the fix?</p>
<p>No idea&#8230; though I do worry no one in the rail network has any clue either.</p>
