				<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm not sure how to frame a response to this one...</p>
<p>I've lived in the UK for all but a few months of my voting-eligible life, and this is not the first general election I've been present for. I remember watching the Swing-o-meter and wrapping my head around marginal constituencies, door-to-door canvassing, and the implied outcome of an apathetic society turning out to be a surprisingly well-informed populous. So I'm not sure how foreign I feel, really.</p>
<p>I'd like to think I think of this election as anyone with an education and interest in the future would.</p>
<p>But what DO I think of this election? </p>
<p>I think that the parties are too strong. I watched my first Parliamentary reading a couple weeks ago, as the Digital Economy Bill became the Digital Economy Act through a process of washup and rush toward as this government hurridly tied off it's loose ends. It was the first time I delved into the Whip system, and surprised myself by how incredibly simple it is: vote the way the party agreed, or your club membership will be revoked (along with your parking permit and gym membership, I like to imagine.) I was appalled that the Members of Parliament, elected to represent the best interests of their constituents, were simply corralled to put up their hands at the right minute, then sauntered off again to continue canvassing. I knew this kind of behaviour existed (I've seen Yes, Minister), but I wasn't aware just how BAD and SHABBY the whole process appears. </p>
<p>There are three clubs, all fighting a terrifyingly expensive popularity contest: all struggling to appear the most like someone You and I might want to be friends with. None seems to realise, of course, that You and Me are different, have widely divergent lives, tastes and perspectives; and that none has a chance in hell of appealing completely to both You and Me, so they split the vast differences by trying to appear as least like someone both of us might hate. The result being very little substantial discusion of policy and potential consequences of slightly-different political machines, with the focus going instead to well-rehearsed catchphrases. </p>
<p>Individual MP's are discouraged from standing out, and indeed, probably don't want to for fear of coming under intense pressure from their Whip, the tabloid press or Jeremy Paxman. This is illustrated by the fact that my local MP, a Mr. Phillip Dunne (Conservative), replied to my concerned letter with one which was identical to one sent out to a friend from a different constituency. Indeed, his letter expressing his concern and the evils of a future Labour government was a replica—verbatum—of one sent to many others across the country. Writing to your MP is like asking for a copy of a printed policy list. </p>
<p>None of the parties seems to exist in the present world. It doesn't seem to have occurred to them that someone might, for example, Google a few lines from their heartfelt letter to find thousands of results showing the same words coming back to them; because the Labour MP's did exactly the same thing. It's all a reflection of committees to which we're not invited.</p>
<p>The parties seem to be driven by a somewhat shadowy aristocracy, and the well-connected and powerful of the world are as present here as they are in other "democracies": Murdoch, Mandelson, and other kingmakers. But I think the real problem is that we're all asked to choose between three closed-door groups. </p>
<p>We could perhaps make a difference to the future of the country by joining one of these groups, I suppose. I guess if enough "normal" people were to be well-enough qualified to raise informed objections, and listen to the other sides of problems; we might, slowly etch our own individual influence into the fabric of our particular club. But we won't, mostly. Because we're already occupied with the choices we've made, and we don't feel particularly drawn to a life of defending our view under ever-increasing scrutiny. The clubs attract the clubby, so we shouldn't be surprised that most politicians appear similar. They're a self-selected population of like-minded or like-skilled individuals, and the outcome is a similar-seeming facade.</p>
<p>That sounds extremely cynical, like it doesn't matter what we do. I don't believe that's true, but I do believe that the system's various checks, balances and inertias prevent us from impacting it very heavily.</p>
<p>Maybe this heavy machinery is a good thing. Maybe they stop radicalisation and the "balance" may be some sort of stabiliser? </p>
<p>So, I'm not sure WHAT to think about this election. Judging from the conversations I've had with colleagues and friends, and from the perspectives on programmes, I'm guessing that's not a particularly foreign state of mind, either.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p><a class="alignright" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/343290180"><img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 5px" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/343290180_8655cc0b74_m.jpg?w=1090" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The tech world is telling a story about the Web and computing, and the mainstream media seem to be catching on. They&#8217;re hearing about clouds, wikis, and the history of the World-wide Web. The whole thing reads like some sort of legend&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>It was an era, long ago, when the folk of Middle Class plugged in their Mo-Dems and listened to arcane, magical sounds as their £120 beige box enabled a blazing 14.4 kb/s connection, and they only had to wait a few minutes to call forth script and from anywhere on earth. It was an age that saw the beginnings of email, where people composed messages and sent them down the phone lines at lightning speeds (unless a packet dropped&#8230;). This was the time of Web 1.0.</p>
<p>Then, the web collapsed. No one used the internet any more. Modems became paperweights and millions of metres of ethernet cable were grubbed up to make room for under-floor heat in offices. The world was quiet, and the people of Middle Class forgot what they knew.</p>
<p>Until, there dawned the advent of Web 2.0. People re-learned their former ways, and improved upon the innovations of their fathers. Instead of sites and pages, they began to use &#8220;Web Apps&#8221; which accomplished Tasks, and they became their masters. The great titan Google was made, and he knew all and directed the world toward knowledge. The elves of the web taught men the ways of blogging and messenging and eventually (when they&#8217;d mastered all these things with wiki-training to boot) Social Media and Networking.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Only, that&#8217;s not exactly how it happened; is it? Many commentators and Alpha Geeks have divided the story of the web into convenient phases, and they&#8217;ve roughly settled around a versioning metaphor common to software. Have a look at your favorite browser, and you&#8217;ll see a version number (Safari 4 for me, if you&#8217;re interested) which lets you know how many iterations have been and gone before. There are certainly noted differences, and turning points, where people phased out their dependence on one thing for the convenience and utility of something better. Tim O&#8217;Reilly, who coined the phrase Web 2.0, wrote a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/what-is-web-20.html">much-linked post</a> in 2005 trying to explain and crystalise some of the trends he was seeing which were different from the first few years of the web. The fact that he had to clarify what he meant, and that it took the non-geek world three years to catch up testifies to the notion that the change was gradual. It makes me think that we missed out all the .1-.10&#8217;s in the version numbers, and many alpha and beta tests along the way.</p>
<p>Now we are engaged in the great Web 3.0, where we are applying the logic of the past to the present and guessing at the future. Only, because no one is actually releasing versions of the web like a good, reliable software company should, the story is much more complicated—and interesting!</p>
<p>There are notable trends, with backers and bloggers riding various waves. But it seems to me that the point of this is a convergence. The mobile web is bringing new sorts of information to people, and they can make use of this info wherever they happen to be because of advances in devices ad connectivity. As phones and web-enabled devices get better, so to do the chips we seem to have embedded all over the place, and we can now begin to have a more clear picture of what we do through the information we gather from our heaters, cars, and pedometers. Also, as more objects become connected, the grunt-work of number-crunching and storage is becoming commoditized into big, efficient, utility-like cloud services, which host and work with our collected information much more effectively than the gadget in your hand could ever hope to do. Others, like ourselves, talk about the Semantic Web, which allows for an evolution from a bunch of connected documents to the explicit connections between bits of information.</p>
<p>But, I see a trend there which is common to all candidates: information. The web allowed for information to be shared, then collaboratively worked. Now, I see this information becoming useful in and of itself&#8230;as data.</p>
<p>Walt Mossberg <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/welcome-to-web-30">talks about Web 3.0</a> as if it is riding on the backs of mobile and connected devices. And I think it probably is. Tim Berners-Lee recently <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8090538.stm">spoke to the BBC</a> about the future of the web including some incredible future of pixels everywhere, where any surface could display information. He&#8217;s also repeatedly talked about the future of the web being semantic (he invented the term, let&#8217;s not forget) where Linked Data is the web done right. And who am I to argue with the inventor of the Web?</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s so much a conflict or competition as a coming together here. If there will be a Web 3.0 (and it seems a likely, media-friendly label), I think it will include all of these trends centred around the focus of data. The connected devices allow us access to cloud-computing and storage (computing and storage of data&#8230;). Many chips gather data about ourselves, which we can use to personalise our view on the web of data, and the Linking of this data through semantics lets it all be calculable, programmable, and useful. It kind of reminds me of a computer, you know&#8230; The chips and our collective use of web applications are input and sources, and the various devices we use are displays and UI&#8217;s onto a massive, scalable CPU in the cloud. Linked Data could be the Operating System, allowing and enabling anything to be connected and programmed.</p>
<p>Web 3.0, to me, is a convergence of the trends, and it&#8217;s all about data. It&#8217;s not a simple story, and any convenient label is to convenient to be comprehensive, but I&#8217;m pretty sure the next things will all  centre on our ability to make use of and personalise vast chunks of previously-obtuse data.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reviews of new Windows releases always seem to say the same thing, depending on what kind of person writes them. Mac enthusiasts say it’s yet again stolen more MacOS features. Microsofties defend the new-found stability and the speed compared to last editions. Non-techies say how pretty this one is in comparison with the last, <em>et cetera</em>. </p>
<p>Well, I’ve got a preview build of Windows 7, and I’d like to give you a three-way look at it.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>Windows 7 already feels stronger and faster than Vista. It installed easily using Bootcamp, and is happily running on my MacbookPro. When I got all the drivers working (to be expected running on an Apple, I suppose) it’s robust and more or less respectable. This particular build/driver combination is particularly nice, because it’s got some special Apple drivers which let it play nice with my keyboard and F-button settings (volume, keyboard and screen brightness, eject).</p>
<p>Windows found my external display fairly quickly, though it would not use it’s full resolution at first. Then, randomly, it let me do so (though nothing had been downloaded or tweaked—it couldn’t; I had yet to connect to my network!). This was a nice surprise, but I kind of wish it would let me choose what’s going on instead of hiding its preferences and features in the background (more on this later).</p>
<p>A slight improvement over Vista is the ease by which Windows 7 seemed to handle getting online. It’s a breeze to select a wireless network and get connected. I also like some of the more subtle things they’ve done with 7, which make it a bit more pleasant to use such as the way they’ve layed-out the control panel settings, and the better file-layout in the navigation panels of explorer windows.</p>
<p>By far, so far, the best thing has been the speed. Windows 7, at this stage, is fast enough to work nicely. I don’t know how it will do after months of updates, registry bloat, and anti-malware software; but it MUST be better than Vista in this regard. Finally, however, is a small thing that I like: Windows Live Writer. It’s great! It’s available for Vista, however, so it’s not new. However, the Live Essentials on this version seem a bit easier to get going and running. Windows Live Writer is the only application that I wish I had on the Mac, and it’s still the best blogging tool out there.</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>Firstly, why is networking with Windows so hard? It found my router, got onto the internet, and updated itself fine. It talks with the Windows Mothership on the cloud easily enough. Would it, however, find my Mac on the same network? My iPhone? Yes… through Bluetooth! When will Windows start to recognise they need to make networking easy for users?</p>
<p>Secondly, this is basically Vista done not-so-badly. It’s, so far, what Vista should have been. Light (ish), easy, stable. But, to me, these are table-stakes. It’s not that impressive to say: “Our operating system doesn’t hang when you use default features! It’s stable, It’s easy!” It should be, why are you so proud of this?</p>
<p>The final reason why this isn’t going to be the best OS out there, however, is that it’s still Windows. Now, before you label me a fanboy or anti-establishmentarian; let me say why this is a problem. There are countless menus and features and settings and objects on this system. There are too many, unconnected settings. Windows Control Panel has 63 icons! OSX, in comparison, makes do with 26. The user also doesn’t often see an immediate effect from a settings change. After several sets of “OK” are pressed, I find out my network adapter’s been disabled, and have to go though a completely different route to get it back. The language used to describe the setup options has always been difficult to follow. Consider the Networking setup: Some based on actions, so you can “set up a new connection or network;” “connect to a network;” “fix network problem” etc. Others are categorical ‘HomeGroup,” “Internet Options,” “Wireless Network Connection” etc… I’ve had to go through every single one of them, and many subsequent menus besides in order to setup my home network. The “wizard” does nothing. It’s always been this way with Windows…you are expected to know exactly where the settings are hidden within some obscure menu, but you’re teased with easy options along the way. My favourite screen so far has been one which says: “Troubleshooting could not identify the problem.” Thanks for the help…</p>
<p>This problem stems from always being the Least Common Denominator. What results is that every set of functions is a compromise of some kind.</p>
<h2>The Not-Ugly but unfortunately Not-Original</h2>
<p>It’s not a new thing to say that this version of Windows is copying Mac. I grew up being told that Windows has stolen every good idea it’s ever had from someone else. While this may have been true with many things, I can’t believe they have never had an original thought. Despite its many shortcomings, Microsoft’s software is the market dominator, and has been for as long as anyone can remember. Sure, they’ve bought companies and talent along the way (so has Google… so has Apple!), but the Live stuff is pretty different, and works decently (except for its annoying insistence that all the services you use should be MS—a characteristic it shares with Apple services like MobileMe.)</p>
<p>Having a look at the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/windows-7" target="_blank">promotional video</a> for VistaII—I mean, Windows 7—and I’m struck by how little there is to say about it.</p>
<p>Firstly: “Windows Gurus”? Tell me that’s not a play on “Apple Geniuses”. You can imagine the board meeting that chose that name: “Right, we need something of an authority on the matter that sounds brainy and starts with G, but isn’t ‘Genius.’ Wilkinson?” “Uh, er, guardian…guarantor…general… guru?”</p>
<p>They seem terribly proud about how the windows all have previews and there’s a brilliant new thing called a Task Bar! Windows has had a taskbar for years, this one just works a bit more like the Dock in OSX. That’s it, move along.</p>
<p>They’ve renamed the “Workgroup” the “Homegroup”, and it does the same thing. It’s tweaked, supposedly, but it’s just a network. I find myself wondering if this a reaction to the “I’m a Mac” ads? “This isn’t work, it’s home. We’ve renamed it, HOME, cause it’s not at work. Get it?”</p>
<p>IE has had a few features added, called “accelerators” which essentially allow for interaction with the web through the browser. It could be a great step, except that there are Firefox folks doing it so much better. Bit.Ly plugin allows for a huge range of interaction with data on the screen through Firefox.&#160; <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/" target="_blank">Ubiquity</a> on Firefox is a genuinely new way of blurring the web, our human interactions, and our machines. “Accelerators” just seem like a glorified right-click or contextual menu. There’s also “InPrivate Browsing” which turns off cookies and history. Guess what Safari has called this? “Private Browsing”. Go figure…</p>
<p>I know this is a preview release, but my overall impression is that Windows 7 should have been launched in 2006. This is great, for a Windows release, it works and pretty well so far. Aside from the basic problem that it is Windows, and works by being everything to everyone, it’s OK. But it’s not exciting, it’s not THAT new, and it feels a bit like we should be seeing a real breakthrough by now.</p>

<div style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/3081354181"><img style="margin: 5px;" title="confetti" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/3081354181_4e7d8a6ff4.jpg?resize=200%2C200" alt="Confetti by mr_gonzales" width="200" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Confetti&quot; by mr_gonzales</p></div>
</div>
<p>I have talked a lot about metaphor, both here and, perhaps sadly, to my friends and family. Metaphor and the abstract are true passions of mine, and I can&#8217;t help but see them everywhere. I suppose, it&#8217;s the nature of metaphor to <em>be</em> everywhere, really.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one thing in terms of another.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229603247&amp;sr=8-1">Lakoff and Johnson</a> (1980)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, seeing (or, &#8220;experiencing&#8221;, since &#8220;seeing&#8221; is really a metaphor) one idea or concept in terms of another is a kind of abstraction. You&#8217;re essentially changing your perspective on something by bringing in another concept. Metaphor, generally, is about comparison and noting the similarity, but I suppose there can be an element of the dissimilarity which makes them work. So, if I use a literary metaphor (comparing two things without the use of a similating word like &#8220;like&#8221; or &#8220;as&#8221;) and say: &#8220;this computer is rubbish&#8221;; I&#8217;m fundamentally making a comparison between the two notions—&#8221;this computer&#8221; and &#8220;rubbish&#8221;. It is the similarity which I am stressing; and, on the surface, using &#8220;rubbish&#8221; as a sort of modifier of the computer.</p>
<p>However, there is a whole plethora of meaning in this statement, if you pull yourself back from it a bit. What&#8217;s rubbish? Rubbish is stuff we throw away; it can smell bad; it&#8217;s collected from our houses and fills holes in the ground; we don&#8217;t want rubbish; we don&#8217;t like rubbish;  it&#8217;s a generic term for things we don&#8217;t like or are unhappy with. With this simple statement, I&#8217;m ever-so-casually bashing together large quantities of information and notion, and letting the meanings fall where they will. Inside this somewhere is the idea of &#8220;propositionality&#8221;, meaning that I&#8217;m letting the hearer of this statement draw their own conclusions to what I&#8217;m saying (he&#8217;s not happy with his computer, his computer may not be very good, he wouldn&#8217;t recommend it, he&#8217;s having a bad day&#8230;) some of which is intended, some of it not (at, least, not consciously). There are also cultural considerations in that there is a sort of social consensus that this metaphor &#8220;works&#8221; and that we must not literally interpret this statement as an intention to physically dispose of an object (which is good when you consider any time you&#8217;ve ever heard a person &#8220;understood or experienced in terms of&#8221; rubbish <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> This leads me to think that there are also elements of disassociation between the two concepts, so that some of the meaning is actually in the difference between &#8220;rubbish&#8221; and &#8220;this computer&#8221;. I&#8217;m probably not going to throw it away (at least, not immediately); It&#8217;s probably something I&#8217;ve bought and have no intention of burying in the ground; I expect to be happy or satisfied with it (whereas, you wouldn&#8217;t about a used tea-bag). So, the two concepts modify each other, they&#8217;re like points in a perspective, making it possible to glean added meaning from the situation which is greater than just the two ideas themselves.</p>
<p>(if you&#8217;re still reading by here, <a href="mailto:zach@zachbeauvais.com">email me</a>, and we&#8217;ll have a pint!)</p>
<p>I mentioned in my previous post that data are used in abstraction. What I mean by this, is that a bit of data is &#8220;used&#8221; in a process when it&#8217;s a point of reference for something. This number + that number = another number, the two numbers are reference points for the sum. When I say: &#8220;I&#8217;m busy on the 2nd&#8221; it means that I&#8217;ve referred to a bit of data (a number on a calendar application, an email, or whatever) that I&#8217;ve used as a point of comparison. I&#8217;ve essentially understood the projected state of my schedule in terms of what i&#8217;ve already planned to occur. And, these bits of data are more and more powerful when the perspective you gain from them is more accurate.</p>
<p>When we get more reference points, and more interactions, our perspective becomes more flexible. We can abstract ourselves right out, and look at a very broad picture. Google&#8217;s Pagerank does this by mining clickstream information from a very, very large dataset using very simple reference points: the number of links to an item increases its position in the rank. Conversely, we can focus right in on a single notion or dataset using as many different references as possible to understand a limited set of transactions. Amazon&#8217;s book results page is full of this kind of perspective with user-ratings, purchase histories, browsing behaviour, and mathematical algorithms to give a very full picture (and options to accomplish a task) of a single notion.</p>
<p>So, I think that data are very similar to metaphor in that they are used to understand one thing (or set of things) in terms of another (or others).</p>
<p>The upshot of this is that we can refer to this <a class="zem_slink" title="Concept" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/Concept">abstract concept</a> of &#8220;data&#8221; in terms that help us to understand both their significance and their utility to us. When I say: &#8220;I want my data to do this&#8221;, it&#8217;s not that helpful unless you understand that I&#8217;m trying to get all my reference points to produce a perspective to help me accomplish something. Which leads me to my main point: the whole point of metaphor is to help—or possibly enable—our understanding. Data should do the same. Collecting all the bits and pieces of information you incur by being a person and doing things should bring you some form of understanding leading to a benefit.</p>

</div>
<p>I have begun to see that we may be entering a new age of polymaths, and I&#8217;m happy to be involved in a part of the business world which seems to sustain some of the best brains on the planet.</p>
<p>I remember reading about the beginners of industry—the pioneers of technology and science. I remember reading how <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Robert_Fulton">Robert Fulton</a> came up against problems in life, and simply invented new ways of doing things, leading eventually to the development of steam-powered paddle-wheel-boats. I remember, vaguely, from my propagandistically pro-industrial schooling that as a child, Fulton had invented or improved on the lead pencil, because the one he was using in school wasn&#8217;t up to scratch. The same story is reflected through many of the West&#8217;s inventors of what we&#8217;ve retrospectively come to call <a class="zem_slink" title="Industrial Revolution" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Industrial_Revolution">the Industrial Revolution</a>: when opportunity or difficulty forced their hands, they changed the situation.</p>
<p>Now, aside from natural romanticism, I like to look to the past with neither rose-tinted glasses nor &#8220;isn&#8217;t-everything-better-now&#8221; short-sightedness. I&#8217;m sure that for every changer, there were crowds of followers in every age, and I&#8217;m sure many of you could point easily to both an earth-changer and a follower without too much effort. Besides, history pays scant attention to followers.</p>
<p>No, what I&#8217;m talking about is the seeming ease with which many of my colleagues in the web industry switch between impressively diverse tasks. Some I know make impressive presenters, and happen to hold PhD&#8217;s in fields more or less unrelated to what they do now&#8230; and can code Java and know a bit of <a class="zem_slink" title="Cascading Style Sheets" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> on the side. I fear to challenge any to play chess (since I haven&#8217;t played in over 5 years, and have the patience of a twelve-year-old), and several are rumoured to be better-than-average musicians. This diversified excellence, alongside the startups, ideas, enthusiastic organisations and programmes i&#8217;ve seen recently, remind me of the society-changers of a century and more ago. Not since then, I think, has such an importance been placed on ambition within social responsibilities.</p>
<div class="alignright"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NgSRwOZtDQ8&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/NgSRwOZtDQ8&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
<p>One of the things I&#8217;ve seen most recently has been the Google 10^100 (apparently pronounced: ten to the one-hundredth with a typically geeky need to explain the pun) which aims to &#8220;help as many people as we can&#8221; by contributing $10million to fund earth-changing ideas. Their site is, in classic Google fashion, very straightforward, so I won&#8217;t repeat their blurb&#8230;just go have a read. But, while you are doing it, I dare you to set aside any cynicism you may harbour either toward a big business, or to any notion of &#8220;changing the world&#8221;. Think about what has and is being done, and then think how you could change the world.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- #BeginTags --><!-- #EndTags --> For avid news readers, not much beats a classic broadsheet newspaper for quality content and writership. Although I use <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/reader">Google Reader</a> to keep up with the best of the blogs, and sometimes skim <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/www.digg.com">Digg</a> for new reads, I keep coming back to the consistent content found on traditional newspapers&#8211;online. That isn&#8217;t to say that everything found at a &#8216;proper&#8217; news site beats everything on a new media service or a blog. Indeed, many blogs have amazingly-tuned insights and offer the best rants on the planet. But, when you want general news, looking through the often opined views of one-man blogs can be a headache. Much blog content is very focused, and most Digg and Technorati articles lean towards the geeky. I landed some time ago at the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/news">Times Online</a> and frequently browse its headlines.</p>
<p>The Times Online has some of my favourite columnists and consistently high-quality comment. Who can resist a rant or opinion from <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/jeremy_clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a>? Alongside, Lord Rees-Mogg and his ilk of commentators whose opinion I have come to respect (if not always with 100% agreement!) However, I do have a few problems with the Times Online. There is, actually, only one major complaint.</p>
<h3>It is so slow!</h3>
<p>It boasts its Windows links and utilizes &#8220;Live Search&#8221; instead of Google, and I wonder if this architecture is what makes it so mind-numbingly time-consuming. Its content is well-positioned and not as graphic heavy as many sites whose load-time is much faster (check out <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/www.topgear.com">Top Gear</a> for an example of a slow site which is faster!). If you want to view many articles in a single sitting and open up multiple tabs (as I am prone to do) You will find them still loading long after you&#8217;ve made a cuppa. I find the layout pleasing, and the ease of navigating its absoultely vast content brilliant; but I can&#8217;t get over how slowly I have to navigate these pages. It also doesn&#8217;t seem to like Firefox very much (thanks Windows integration?). If you have any better news sites, let me know. It is still worth a look, though, for it simply houses some of the best news content online!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/#comments">Engadget</a>, I noticed a post about much-rumoured &#8220;Google Phone&#8221;. Apparently, they have it on good authority that the people over at Google are working on their own Mobile OS. The interesting bit, though, is that Google has been working very closely with <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/www.apple.com">Apple </a>on the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/iphone">iPhone</a> project. If they launch their own Google Phone (gPhone, Googlephone, whatever&#8230;) they will be in direct competition.</p>
<p>What I wonder, however, is whether Google and Apple are playing even closer together. Imagine two companies more able to launch intuitive products and acquire companies and methods in order to put them to better use within a larger structure. Google, recently, has been launching its <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/a">Web Office</a> while hoovering up smaller developers to bring in the very best of web-based and hybrid (web/desktop) applications. What does Google need next?</p>
<p><b>Brilliant hardware.</b> Who builds better hardware than Apple?</p>
<p>This is only a guess, but what happens if Google and Apple work closer on mobile tech? Instead of direct competition (which would only result in a proliferation of one-upmanship devices and platforms with little long-term customer satisfaction) a JV of some description could result in the best of breed mobile devices (and why just mobile) with a very long shelf life!</p>
<p>What do you reckon?</p>
