<p>I tend to live in a world of metaphor. It&#8217;s not my fault, according to Lakoff and Johnson. We all use metaphor all the time: to construct our thoughts and work out abstract concepts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been exploring this a bit in the context of the Semantic Web over on Nodalities. Please feel free to have a look and send me some feedback on what you think about this set of ideas.</p>

<blockquote><p>The essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing on kind of thing in terms of another. &#8211;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/0226468011">Lakoff and Johnson (1980)</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Would you join me for a party?</p>
<p>It’s a black-tie, invite-only affair at the family estate. If you can make it, I’ll send you some directions and an invitation and a photo name-badge. Please don’t forget to bring it with you; there was an unfortunate incident last summer with a guest and the guards at the gate. Don’t worry, we don’t have those dogs any more: poor things had to be put down.</p>
<p>Sound inviting?</p>
<p>I’d like to explore the idea of Semantic Web metaphors. For a bit of background, I’m coming at this from the perspective that metaphor plays a key role in the way we think as well as the way we communicate. The idea of a ‘conceptual metaphor’ comes from Lakoff and Johnson and their collaborative <i>Metaphors we Live By</i>. The idea is that, because we’re all people, and all people are similar in many ways (we all have bodies, our bodies face in one direction, we perceive a huge amount of information by site) that we actually share common metaphorical constructions which allow our minds to deal with abstract concepts like time and numbers. Given the importance of these frameworks, it might be an idea to look at some common or easily-accessed technological metaphors and see how the Semantic Web fits in with these. This could help to explore the way we think and access the concepts behind the Semantic Web, and could inform the way we communicate about it.</p>
<p>The Semantic Web is not a Walled Garden.</p>
<p>The first metaphor I’d like to look at is actually a contrasting system: understanding the Semantic Web in terms of something it’s not: a walled garden.</p>
<p>In information technology, a ‘<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/Walled_garden_%2528media%2529">Walled Garden</a>’ is a system which doesn’t link or accept links from an outside network. All the information inside is only available to members of that system and the content found within the system has to be admitted or imported. If we play around this walled garden metaphor, we can imagine seeing nice specimen plants with well-spaced labels and possibly some glass in between us and the more expensive displays. There might even be a gazebo with some exceedingly rare plants on display. To get in, you need to buy a ticket, and pay an extra fiver for a guide book. A lot of work went into the building of the garden and the arrangement and upkeep of the displays, so they’re charging for entry and keeping the best stuff for premium ticket holders.</p>
<p>This is exactly what happened at the beginning of the internet. Various internet service providers provided access to selected content, and graded it so they could charge for premium stuff. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this scenario, it’s a very standard arrangement and works well with people’s perceptions of how to access a service (like buying a ticket, or ordering a service like digital TV). The web, however, changed this perception as more and more people began to experience the freedom of accessing any information at any time. The WWW experienced a huge network effect as the walled-garden business model faded from the game-board.</p>
<p>The Walled Garden metaphor, however, could also be extended to include data systems, silos, basically anywhere data is kept in proprietary systems. The Web 2.0 ecosystem is filled with various walled gardens. Think of your favorite web app, and consider its characteristics. Which features only work within that system? What data can you access through the service?</p>
<p>Social networking sites and applications are particularly easy to categorize this way. How many networks are you registered with? LinkedIn, Facebook, MySpace… Did any of these networks know who you were before you signed up? Did they know your friends until you told them? Can you point to a profile of a friend who’s not part of the system?</p>
<p>The basic business model of these walled gardens is to get as many people inside the walls as possible. So, if you’re friends with someone in one network, say Facebook, you can’t link your Facebook profile to a mate’s on Bebo or MySpace. These are separate gardens, each holding their own parties… and the owners can only cater for the invited guests. They’re happy for you to invite others (provided you give them their information); but they’re not out to through an open buffet to anyone who hasn’t signed the guest list!</p>
<p>“Wait!” I can hear you say: “What about when an application asks for my email address so it can find my friends?” Well, that’s exactly what it’s asking: for you to invite your friends to their party. There are even applications which have been built to link the walled gardens: but you have to be on their platform. Plaxo is an example of this. The idea is that you sign up to Plaxo (you join their garden party) and you tell them all the networks you’ve already joined (you give them your invitations to all the other parties). In a sense, you’re joining another party, which is essentially tracking all your invitations for you—they map the parties for you. The catch is that you have to join Plaxo for it to work, essentially seeing all the other gardens from the vantage of a slightly higher garden. The effect is that you get a map of all the other parties, but you still don’t get lunch!</p>
<p>The Semantic Web works from a different perspective. By being an <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/Open_world_assumption">open-world system</a>, the Semantic Web works across the entire network (which, in this case, is the internet) using the entire web (the links created among content on the network: in this case: the WorldWideWeb!) The idea is that all the information you make available, and all that you have a link to is open to the entire network. The result is a removal of the ‘walls’ around content.</p>
<p>I would be very interested to hear what you think about how the Semantic Web relates to Walled Gardens, and in what ways you think it breaks down walls (or otherwise). Please feel not only free but invited to leave comments to join the discussion.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are we, as a society or set of societies too quick to categorise?</p>
<p>I think we have built upon the Victorian-era&#8217;s predilection for classification for understanding. You&#8217;ll notice, no doubt, that I categorised the idea of classification as Victorian. Perhaps this is a helpful metaphorical conduit for expressing a large number of semantic nuances&#8211;a sort of communicative shorthand. When I mention &#8216;Victorian&#8217;, loads of images appear in my mind: women in petticoats and parasols, men with mustaches, steam engines, industrial buildings, red-brick, tea, lack of smiles&#8230; and a corresponding set of ideas begins to emerge rather like a tag-cloud which gets more intricate the longer you focus on a single tag.</p>
<p>But, what if this becomes a hindrance to meaning. I am not alone in experiencing the frustration involved when someone tries to categorise you. My wife, a veterinary surgeon, was recently introducing herself to a middle-aged woman who had asked us how long we&#8217;d lived in our town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I recently got a job in the vet&#8217;s practice,&#8221; says my wife (who&#8217;s blessed with ageless looks which often leave people stunned to learn her real age)</p>
<p>&#8220;Really! Do you need some sort of qualification to do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Both my wife and I had to bite back any reproach involved in explaining that it does indeed take quite a bit of training and qualification before being allowed to take a job as a practicing veterinary surgeon, the last of which being five-years&#8217; worth of 40+-hour weeks of a veterinary degree and harrowing RCVS examinations.</p>
<p>What the woman was trying to do, of course, was to find out whether Wendy works there as a nurse or sweeping floors and cleaning kennels. Her surprise proved this when Wendy laughingly explained that she&#8217;s a vet and therefore has several necessary qualifications.</p>
<p>What this illustrates is a time when the categories we use as a conceptual structure don&#8217;t fit. The woman&#8217;s whole perception of my wife came to a crashing, embarrassing end when she was forced to re-render her conceptual structure. Now, I believe that we, as humans, require certain conceptual and metaphorical constructs in order to turn our perceptions into understandings. They, in essence, allow us to contain a concept in order to analyse it and let our <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/Abstract_structure">abstract processes work</a>. They give non-physical concepts substance so we can get our physical brains around them. (For more, I highly recommend Lakoff and Johnson&#8217;s <em><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1207396962&amp;sr=8-1">Metaphors we Live By</a>).</em></p>
<p>What I am beginning to wonder is whether there is a glitch in the natural necessity for these constructs. What happens if a society becomes transfixed with its own metaphors? Or, maybe it&#8217;s just that the shorthand is used too freely? What does it mean to be &#8216;post-modern&#8217;, &#8216;ecological&#8217;, &#8216;ethical&#8217;, or any number of tags we use to convey huge propositions of meaning? I propose that conceptual tagging, and the short-hand language of metaphor is fast becoming the newest form of cliche. We are learning, culturally, to package more meaning than we understand ourselves into ever-smaller packages. Communication is beginning to break down at some levels due to ambiguity and a lack of understanding so that the entire semantic package is not necessarily being transmitted.</p>
<p>If I am having a conversation about industriousness, working hard, or innovation, I use the idea of &#8216;Victorian&#8217; in a very different way from its use in a dialogue about expressive freedom, colonialism or interior design. So, to a certain extent, the context of the conversation is important. But what is actually happening when someone uses &#8216;toxins&#8217;, &#8216;carbs&#8217;, and &#8216;omega-3&#8217; as tags for &#8216;unhealthy&#8217;, &#8216;bad for you&#8217;, and &#8216;beneficial&#8217; respectively? I&#8217;d love to understand this phenomenon of communication more fully.</p>
<p>Please note: I am not attacking culture, education or the general state of the world, but trying to explore the concepts of understanding and communication. If you have ideas, please let me know them.</p>
