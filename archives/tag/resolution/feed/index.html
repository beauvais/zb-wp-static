								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is now 2008, and I wish you all the best for it. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been asked by all the friends who shared the ringing of the new in last night about new years&#8217; resolutions I might have. </p>
<p>I tend to be very abstract, and can&#8217;t really put an exact goal down, and have always felt a bit pressured to make something sound important and amazing without being pretentious. I plan to lose two stone or climb a mountain or travel more or read better books&#8230; These are all kinds of things I&#8217;d like to do, and might. But I don&#8217;t want the added pressure of people knowing, especially because most people wouldn&#8217;t remember anyway.</p>
<p>I am blessed enough to have friends who would remember, actually, and that makes me even more disinclined to set a list of resolutions. For a particular friend, her last year&#8217;s resolutions all turned out to be blessings, and she fulfilled them. I think she&#8217;s amazing, and wish her all the best for this years, and I can see how, to her, the resolutions are challenges and exciting possibilities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, any resolutions I might put down tend to carry with them the taint of guilt. Thoughts of: &quot;oh, that was too much food, that&#8217;s another resolution lost&quot; or &quot;why am I reading this, I thought I was trying to better my mind&#8230;?&quot; are more prominent than the excitement of challenges. </p>
<p>So, I won&#8217;t be making any resolutions for this year. Instead, I will try to focus more on the actual idea of meeting challenges, and work on a fundamental difference between me and resolutions themselves. If I resolve to to something, it becomes a chore, and I want to change that perception.</p>
<p>So, although that sounds very much like a resolution, I hope you&#8217;ll forgive me for being abstract even about something as inane as New Year Resolutions, and wish you all the best and blessings in 2008.</p>
