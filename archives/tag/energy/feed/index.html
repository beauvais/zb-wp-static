								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/3460225998"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 5px;" title="lucas" src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/3460225998_84cec64236_m.jpg?resize=180%2C240" alt="" width="180" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>When Lucas joined our household, I knew he&#8217;d make a great working dog. His sire was a steady, dependable sort who is used for picking up, and Lucas took immediately to retrieving. Not only do I like the idea of having him with me in the field, but I can also see just how much dogs seem to enjoy the challenges working to gun seem to bring. But I knew it had to start somewhere, so I ordered a few training dummies that had caught my eye at a game fair last autumn. I thought these woiuld be a better size for him, since they came as either partridges or pheasants, and I had started the pup out pretty early to work off some of his unlimited supply of energy.</p>
<p>When they arrived, I was surprised by the dummies themselves. They were made to a very high standard, with a pleasant shape (they fly really well off their toggles!). I&#8217;ve since discovered that they float, can take just about as much munching as Lucas can give as he stumbles up hills, and last much better than the other one I bought (which, if I recall, was actually more expensive). I was interested in why they seemed so well-thought-out, since they&#8217;re essentially just a bag on which to practice retrieving. I quickly found their weak-point, however, when the dummy landed toggle-side down on a stone: the shiny molded plastic shattered! My interest with the company, however, was further piqued when I ordered a few more, and I found the toggle to be a made of hard rubber, which bounced and gripped even better in my hands. This was iterative design, working to make an ever-increasing standard without changing the price or making a feature of general improvements. Being so impressed, I contacted the makers (the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/www.workingdogcompany.co.uk">Working Dog Company</a>) to find out their story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ian has been working his Labradors for a number of years. One of them had a particular problem delivering the standard type of dummy to hand. He either held it by one end like he was smoking a big cigar, or he tossed it around his head by the toggle flap. I spoke to a number of people and gun dog handlers about this problem and it seemed not to be unique to me or my dog. I could not find a dummy on the market that would help me, so I discussed the problem with my daughter who is a designer for a top country clothing retailer and supplier. We decided if we were going to start from scratch, lets change the shape to more closely resemble the shape of a game birds body. Make it softer for the dogs to hold and reduce the size of the toggle flap so that the dog would not be tempted to take hold of it. We came up with this design, offered it in 2 sizes: the Partridge to be utilised as a puppy dummy and the Pheasant to make a dog open its gape and carry as we would expect it to hold a shot bird.</p>

<p>They have proved very popular, demand has been high and we received 2 very good reviews in the shooting press, namely <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/www.basc.org.uk"> BASC </a>Nov edition magazine and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/www.shootingtimes.com"> Shooting Times</a>. To view these testimonials visit our web site. We are now providing to a number of gun dog training clubs, professional handlers and shipping out to Scandinavian countries where gun dog training and handling is almost a national past time.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really like seeing innovation in things that often go un-noticed. I can say that my little pup definitely prefers retrieving the Working Dog Company dummies. In fact, it&#8217;s difficult to make him retrieve the other if he&#8217;s allowed his preference! It&#8217;s certainly a success story so far, and I wish the WDC great luck in future.</p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;Hi, Fred. Nice Jumper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, thanks&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>My old music instructor used to have a saying: &#8220;It&#8217;s not what you say, it&#8217;s how you say it.&#8221; It became a bit of a mantra. Our high-school band benefited from this saying whenever he pointed out that while our notes might have been right, and our rhythm more or less on time, the pieces still sounded &#8220;damp&#8221;, &#8220;flat&#8221;, &#8220;wishy-washy&#8221; or a host of other qualifiers. He&#8217;d say, &#8220;Think about two people: one says to the other: &#8216;Nice shirt&#8230;&#8217; in a tone which makes you think his next thought is: &#8216;I didn&#8217;t know the charity shop did give-aways?&#8217; He didn&#8217;t really mean it&#8217;s a nice shirt, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this mantra applies to any creative situation, and It&#8217;s something from which everyone from artists to executive managers can benefit. However, I&#8217;d go a bit further than Mr. Smith did. I&#8217;d say: &#8220;It&#8217;s not what you say, it&#8217;s that you say it <em>well</em>!&#8221; For me, it&#8217;s a balance between getting the notes right, and making sure the tune&#8217;s lively. Or, to break out of this moderately over-extended metaphor, making sure your processes, data, procedures, and the rest are done right, but also that they&#8217;re put to their best use.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all very well having high-quality data, dutifully collected over the course of a project, stored well, and properly curated. If, at the end of the project, the only thing you have to report is that you have such data, it seems to me the project was a bit damp, wishy-washy or flat. Or, maybe your data are put to use, but they&#8217;re presented in a plain, non-innovative way, they&#8217;re never going to reach their full potential. It&#8217;s the balance between high-quality data, and a well-developed application. It&#8217;s at this interplay between planning and execution, I think, that projects live or die.</p>
<p>Nor is this just about software development. Governmental projects, street-parties, departmental mergers, and buying Christmas presents would all seem to me to need this balance to succeed. The interplay is the hard part, and it&#8217;s a balance of resource allocation, strategy, timing and creativity. It&#8217;s also the most unpredictable point, and it&#8217;s reflected everywhere:</p>
<p>That moment you throw the ingredients into a heated pan, or begin plating up your party meal</p>
<p>That bit between re-reading and publishing a blog post</p>
<p>That split-second before saying a comforting phrase to a hurting friend</p>
<p>The seconds between shelf and shopping basket</p>
<p>The hours between announcement and &#8220;go live&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s exciting, it&#8217;s nerve-racking, it&#8217;s crucial. All of these will fail, or fail to impress, if the execution and assessment are not aligned. Cooking rubbish steak well will be hard work for little reward. A well-written article without a good understanding or decent research will fall flat; or, likewise, a stack of well-thought-out ideas or conclusions thrown into a document without care or skill wrecks weeks of hard graft. And the list goes on.</p>
<p>So, what am I saying?</p>
<p>Make sure your projects, whether at work or at home, are well-planned. But, don&#8217;t waste this effort with a poor execution or an epic fail at the last hurdle. It&#8217;s the best stuff born from the energy of this balance that you&#8217;ll remember and will provide stepping stones for future work. And, frankly, you owe it to yourself, your customers, and society to stop ticking along.</p>
<p>Plan in some innovation at the beginning of a project. A dinner party with a bit of &#8220;<em>je ne sais quoi&#8221; </em>doesn&#8217;t just happen, and it&#8217;ll need some time to get the tweks and &#8220;I&#8217;d never have thought of that&#8221; moments. Your non-profit will let your cause down if you continue to do what&#8217;s always been done or over-use an idea that worked so well in 1995.</p>
<p>Tune your instruments, ladies and gentlemen, but make sure you&#8217;re in tune yourselves.</p>
<p>Or, as Mr. Smith used to say: &#8220;It needs to sound so good, it&#8217;ll turn goats piss into gasoline!&#8221; And no one could ever think of any reply&#8230;</p>
