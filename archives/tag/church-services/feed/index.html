<p>Because I work with the internet, I tend to see things from an &#8216;online&#8217; perspective. When I see a presentation, I ask why it doesn&#8217;t link to resources and I tend to Google answers and keep many tabs open with on-the-fly further reading on a subject. One of the most wide-spread of all internet buzzwords is &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221;. The ideas behind it have been summed up (indeed, coined) by the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oreillynet.com%2Fpub%2Fa%2Foreilly%2Ftim%2Fnews%2F2005%2F09%2F30%2Fwhat-is-web-20.html&amp;ei=qWzVRvCkCJCkwgHhodzFDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrMnlCMikX1cayz1Xzjf4TVVTr9Q&amp;sig2=Uyh4bM1oyRKsMEnLupopKg">O&#8217;Reilly network</a>. To me, many of these have a strong resonance with the &#8216;newly painted church&#8217; of Mars Hill. For example, there is an emphasis in Web 2.0 on participation and &#8220;The long tail&#8221; which I see reflected in &#8220;every member ministry&#8221; and discussions instead of sermons. Teaching has taken on a very interactive flavour, and theology is less about rules.</p>
<p>While the tag &#8216;Church 2.0&#8217; is wildly inaccurate on one score (e.g. there have been many renditions of the church), the notion of a renaissance is definitely present and many of the tenets of Web 2.0 can be helpfully used as metaphor in the church.</p>
<p><b>Participation vs. Preaching:</b></p>
<p>With links to various incarnations of the &#8216;Cell&#8217; movement, the idea of discussion supplementing or even replacing pulpit-sermons is certainly not new. The practice of church services on Sunday mornings, however, tends to keep its principle of being taught from the front. I think this is changing, however, and I think we will see a decline in traditional sermons with points backed by scripture. My old church in the States believed in an &#8216;expository&#8217; teaching style. The idea being that the Bible would be taught through, verse-by-verse instead of shaping its truth to a pre-fabricated set of points. I believe the next step is working out the meaning of the Bible together with a collaborative teaching in which people ask and answer their own questions. While I have yet to completely read Mars Hill&#8217;s &#8216;Narrative Theology&#8217; I can see reflections there.</p>
<p>A wise friend of mine recently told me: &#8220;<i>The truth&#8217;s in the dialogue</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where does the pitfall lie in this new direction?</p>
<p><strong>The Body and the Long Tail:</strong></p>
<p>There will be more&#8230;</p>
