								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently asked a very interesting question via <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/zbeauvais">formspring</a>. An anonymous person asked me:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the ability to &#8220;filter&#8221; &#8212; to absorb information from many sources and produce a useful result, quickly &#8212; is what really defines the &#8220;digital native.&#8221; Your thoughts?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Below is my response. I&#8217;d be interested in what you think.</strong></p>
<p>Interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>Ok, so this idea is pretty loaded: it&#8217;s full of meaning. &#8220;digital native&#8221; is a phrase which is semantically rich, and possibly not very precise. It sounds like the kind of topic which could have an entire book&#8217;s worth of words written to describe the meanings.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take one crack at it, though, by using a subject I better understand: linguistics.</p>
<p>In linguistics, we talk about different kinds of language users. Generally, there are native users and non-native, with many exceptions and all sorts of complications when you start looking into the ethnography of the topic. But, essentially, native language users absorb a language through their childhood (the ability to &#8220;acquire&#8221; language in this way seems to disappear around puberty), and they develop a fluency in it. Many linguists believe that this also shapes their thought patterns—i.e.: a native of English <em>thinks</em> in English in some way. Most at least agree that there is also cultural acquisition of some nature too. It&#8217;s all context.</p>
<p>Now, if I don&#8217;t speak a language and I want to learn, I can learn through what many linguists call &#8220;competencies&#8221;. The idea is, very basically, that people think and learn in different ways, so develop different tactics. So, some might have a natural tendency to learn words, grammatical forms and therefore develop strategies which allow them to learn vocabulary. Others use a communicative competency, and learn by trying to communicate rather than learn a form and learn basically through trial and error. (It&#8217;s closely tied with personality: some people are happy to make mistakes verbally, others are more happy to learn on their own etc&#8230;).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going this circuitous route, because I think the way someone learns a non-native language might be a helpful metaphor for the way people work with trends with which they&#8217;re unfamiliar. So, in this metaphor, a &#8220;digital native&#8221; will have the natural acquisition and competencies which come from existing in an online (I assume that&#8217;s at least part of what you mean by &#8220;digital, by the way) world. They&#8217;re used to many sources, ubiquitous connection, visual information on any topic instantly, multi-media content and hardware that&#8217;s actually quite complex to use. The thing is, to a native, it&#8217;s not a very conscious thing. Someone born into an interconnected world would be more frustrated with NOT being able to find out about anything, about not having some form of connection to information and by being unable to understand their hardware. Filtering information is less of a conscious act and more of a subconscious process. They live in a very full world, so they have already developed ways to work with all this information.</p>
<p>You might see more clearly the idea of native and non-native through different competencies, and perhaps whether the way someone thinks and frames their conscious efforts are affected by the presence of connection. Does a &#8220;digital native&#8221; think to try terribly hard to remember someone&#8217;s phone number, working out some sort of pneumonic or rhythm to memorise it? Or would they only have to if their connection were severed?</p>
<p>So, this is a long road to one context in which filtering might be a part of the competency of a &#8220;digital native&#8221;. I don&#8217;t, however, think it&#8217;s definitive; any more than saying someone who can pronounce the &#8220;th&#8221; sound is therefore defined as a &#8220;Native of English&#8221;. There are myriad concepts which are begged to be explored in the idea of being a native anything: context, competencies, aspirations, metaphorical constructs etc etc etc. But, I think the idea that someone born into a community which has lots of information will develop a certain fluency in dealing with it. They might think differently, or simply have had the tools in their &#8220;hands&#8221; for longer—moving from conscious cerebral thought about information to more subconscious, automatic use of digital tools. Filtering, in this construct, is a competency—a skillset and general tendency of a digital world. Natives would be better, non-natives would have to learn by comparing with their own skills and adapting.</p>
<p>But, I think the phrase &#8220;digital native&#8221; could be too full of loosely-encoded meaning to be very precise, or even useful without a wider, shared understanding of what you mean by it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/www.kiva.org"></a>It&#8217;s been a few months since I last spoke about Kiva.org, and I wanted to bring it up again. </p>
<p>Since writing, I&#8217;ve tried out the lending scheme, and am blown away with the ability to make a difference to places where it&#8217;s seriously needed. Not only has Kiva created an infrastructure for microlending which makes it incredibly easy to lend small amounts to entrepreneurs in developing countries, but it makes use of the very nature of the Web in connecting you with people all over the world. </p>
<p>The idea of &#8216;sponsorship&#8217; isn&#8217;t really stressed. This isn&#8217;t a: &#8220;For pennies a day, you could clean this water&#8230;&#8221; It&#8217;s much more of a chance to invest directly into the lives of people who need it, and have a chance to pull themselves up. </p>
<p>My primary worry, when lending (giving) is that I&#8217;ll be made to feel like a vouyer in some way. Instead of concern, I worry that I will be made to focus on fascination or curiosity. This doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case with Kiva. Although it doesn&#8217;t feel like a standard business transaction, it does present enough facts in a straight-forward way. There is not over-blown language, but clear presentation of cases.</p>
<p>I also feel more comfortable lending directly to &#8220;partners&#8221; in developing nations. I feel this is much more efficient, and more in the spirit of a digital age. Why would I want to pay the salary of a well-meaning (and not, in any way exploitative) but still Western individual with my giving, when I can invest directly in people already poised to make a difference?</p>
<p>Finally, and possibly most importantly: Kiva doesn&#8217;t take any cut of the loans they provide. Instead, they ask for a separate donation (without any nag or detriment to the service). They don&#8217;t make a big deal of this (rightly), but I feel I should mention it. These people are providing a world-changing service, with few resources, without charging anything for &#8216;upkeep&#8217;. Not only that, but they only ask after you&#8217;ve chosen an amount and a project to support, making it less likely for you to lower your loan amount at that stage to compensate the infrastructure.</p>
<p>To my mind, this is the future of peer-to-peer investment and development. Now, we just need a way to send other resources in a similar infrastructure (education, information, digital resources, experience, and design).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have subscribed to Tim Ferriss&#8217; blog for a few weeks, and have found its content enlightening and interesting. Having done a degree in applied linguistics, I found the his item about <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/how-to-learn-but-not-master-any-language-in-1-hour-plus-a-favor">learning a language in an hour</a> interesting, if slightly mis-named.</p>
<p>Tim reckons that you can work out how to learn a language in about an hour, but not actually become fluent in it in that time. He lays out a plan for analysing and comparing differences between languages we might already know with a target language, and using that information to make decisions about how to learn.</p>
<p>As part of my studies at Kings, we looked at learning styles and communicative competencies. (Check out <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1">George Yule</a> for more on linguistics). I would have thought that the idea that you can focus on a particular tactic for learning a language lies partly with the language itself (and for that, Tim&#8217;s blog entry seems completely apt), but also on identifying one&#8217;s own learning styles and techniques. Then, a language could be tackled in a way which makes use of one&#8217;s particular strengths while focusing on the areas which would most help.</p>
<p>I recommend Tim&#8217;s blog, and think it&#8217;s well worth a few hours reading!</p>
