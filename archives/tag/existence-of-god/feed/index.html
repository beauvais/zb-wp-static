				<description><![CDATA[<p>No, I haven't mistaken, though I do wish whoever you are had read my response in its entirety. I did not say that atheism *is* a religion, I said that atheists "can be religious themselves."</p>
<p>I don't really want to get into an impassioned, anonymous argument about atheism and deism. I feel the world confirms my rational belief in design and benign order. I believe that selfless love is a better way to live than pseudo-altruistic opportunity, and that God exists. I don't call all atheists evil, nor do I think their belief system inferior to mine. I disagree with it, and I have experienced a God of Love greater than my own doubt (which is often the greatest thing in my own life).</p>
<p>I do, however, think that there is a religion of atheism. To me, religion is evident whenever people flock to an order (and hierarchy, perhaps) to be exclusive. They tend to disparage others. The implied insult—that I, as a believer in God am superstitious—in the question makes me wonder whether the questioner may have religious tendencies him/herself.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**Regarding atheists, are you sure you haven&#8217;t mistaken a refusal to believe anything without verifiable evidence for a &#8220;belief&#8221;? Atheism is grounded in rational thought and a rejection of superstition. It is not yet another religion to choose from.**</p>
