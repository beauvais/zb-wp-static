				<description><![CDATA[<p>Guide to what? </p>
<p>Emotion is for interactions with people and yourself. I feel a certain way, and I have to question why and to what extent. I feel a reaction to or perceive the emotions of another, and I  modify my behaviour.</p>
<p>Intuition, I don't understand completely. I see it almost as an inclination, a set of skills or simply things one has practiced more. I'm intuitively perceptive to rhythm (That's how I see it, anyway), so I suppose this would be a good guide to specific things, like playing music or creativity. An artist subconsciously guides their medium, intuitively placing and removing and creating and forming. Thinking too hard breaks the instinct.</p>
<p>Consciousness is being aware. Without this, all other perception simply doesn't exist. It's like light: no matter how healthy your eyes may be, or how quick your reflexes or tuned your appreciations and intuitions, you cannot see without it. I suppose all other senses feed into this, and it's up to our minds to sort it, to ponder it, to make decisions.</p>
