								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is based on a post which appeared on formspring.me/zbeauvais</em><br />
I think the instinct—for lack of a better word—that draws people to act religiously can also affect people with no official religion. While there may be no organised creed, there is organisation in a sort of tribal way. This may be in some way related to a culture of the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Tribe">tribe</a>. It&#8217;s the same thing that allows me to identify the tribes of midwestern Christians from America by their handshake, clothing, and sociolect. It&#8217;s the instinct that makes people buy into a group mentality like Apple fanboys, football supporters, and wine snobs.</p>
<p>I believe there to be a <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/New_atheism">culture</a> developing around <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Richard_Dawkins">Dawkins</a> and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Christopher_Hitchens">Hitchens</a> and others. There are events like Godless and books like <em><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1275774092&amp;sr=8-1">An Atheist&#8217;s guide to Christmas</a></em> which are somewhat organising, I suppose. Also, given the list of people who have contributed (among whom are many people I admire) I would be surprised if they don&#8217;t make compelling, interesting and probably very funny reading. But I think the compelling and funny part of the atheist culture is not part of being fundamentally against others&#8217; beliefs, or against God or &#8220;a god&#8221;. I think the idea of &#8220;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Antitheism">antitheism</a>&#8221; is a far less compelling mindset. I don&#8217;t like the idea that one sets their belief and rhetoric as an antithesis.</p>
<p>A possibly relevant illustration would be to look at this in terms of other antithesis positions, like political rhetoric based entirely on the principle of &#8220;not being them.&#8221; It makes your position one relative to the existence, status, and nature of your opposition, which I think is at least silly and at most dangerous. If I were to consider myself to be an &#8220;antiTory,&#8221; then I am simply diametrically opposed to the ideas of a party over which I have forfeited any constructive influence. What then for instance, if they do something I agree with? Being convinced for yourself that there is no god is different from setting yourself against the whole notion as the basis of your beliefs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think all people who disbelieve in God are &#8220;fundamentalist atheists.&#8221; I don&#8217;t equate a person&#8217;s belief and perspective with religiosity. What I do think is that people can religiously follow a group or concept. The word fundamentalist itself is difficult to work with. It&#8217;s something that is understood to be positive by people I wouldn&#8217;t always think of as fundamentally fundamentalist themselves. For some, the idea of being fundamental is to be true to an idea, and this is not a bad thing in itself. I can fundamentally believe it is best to to act selflessly, to edify others, and this would clearly not be negative.</p>
<p>But I think the word has been used commonly to refer to a kind of self-subsumation into the tribe, culture and ideology of a group. News reports of &#8220;fundamentalist terrorists,&#8221; which is probably unhelpful, but the word seems to convey a meaning that is useful sometimes, when talking about individuals who surrender their own perspectives to the tribe.</p>
<p>So, in a similar way to how I think of fundamentalist religious people, I would probably consider a &#8220;fundamentalist atheist&#8221; to be one who believes strongly that there is no god. One who believes that he is in a superior position for believing this way, and that those who believe otherwise are in some sense inferior (pagan, heathen, barbaric perhaps?). And, it would be a person for whom atheism fills a sociological need to belong to a tribe more than it fills the answer to a personal question about the meaning(s) of life.</p>
<p>I fully understand the desire to break free from religious thinking and teaching, and the need to feel unconstrained by a tribal group. I also understand the social desire to feel looked after, cherished and loved and affirmed by being part of something bigger than myself. These tensions are difficult to balance, and I think people find their own ways to do so. I think the balance shifting uncontrollably toward seeking the approval or support of a social group organised around a set of ideas (teaching, creed, reasoning, books and the rest) can only lead to a loss of one&#8217;s own, unique perspective. It&#8217;s a loss to the world.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>No, I haven't mistaken, though I do wish whoever you are had read my response in its entirety. I did not say that atheism *is* a religion, I said that atheists "can be religious themselves."</p>
<p>I don't really want to get into an impassioned, anonymous argument about atheism and deism. I feel the world confirms my rational belief in design and benign order. I believe that selfless love is a better way to live than pseudo-altruistic opportunity, and that God exists. I don't call all atheists evil, nor do I think their belief system inferior to mine. I disagree with it, and I have experienced a God of Love greater than my own doubt (which is often the greatest thing in my own life).</p>
<p>I do, however, think that there is a religion of atheism. To me, religion is evident whenever people flock to an order (and hierarchy, perhaps) to be exclusive. They tend to disparage others. The implied insult—that I, as a believer in God am superstitious—in the question makes me wonder whether the questioner may have religious tendencies him/herself.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**Regarding atheists, are you sure you haven&#8217;t mistaken a refusal to believe anything without verifiable evidence for a &#8220;belief&#8221;?
