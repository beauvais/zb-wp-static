								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/5288168443"><img class="alignleft" alt="Tablet" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/5288168443_0eb8499505_m.jpg?w=1090" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The more I use it, the more conflicted I am about the iPad. It&#8217;s bright and renders images beautifully. I love the way designers are now taking this big screen into account when they produce apps like <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/products">Pulse</a> news reader and <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/frypaper-an-interview-with-the-man-behind-stephen-frys-ipad-app/">FryPaper</a>. It&#8217;s really fun for showing photos to people.</p>
<p>But—and there are so very many buts—it&#8217;s not brilliant for writing or taking notes. It&#8217;s super fast on slideshows, but takes ages to type, correct, select, copy, and paste. Editing text is still annoying after weeks of practice.</p>
<p>Blogging, as I&#8217;m doing now, keeps reminding me how much easier this would be on my trusty laptop. That image I want to use isn&#8217;t quite right, so I&#8217;ll skip it. What I won&#8217;t do is try to find a good image editor app that actually doesn&#8217;t resize, then find another that does but hides the file somewhere I&#8217;ll never see it deep in the workings of the iPad, I assume. So i won&#8217;t do that&#8230;again.</p>
<p>Dedicated apps can be brilliant, but the ones for services I use aren&#8217;t always. The WordPress app, for example, is terrible. There isn&#8217;t an iPad version of the excellent tumblr app for iPhone at all. So, for most things, it&#8217;s site-based tools missing letters like tumblr and flickr. But these don&#8217;t always render well, and if they need Flash, you&#8217;re obviously stuffed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also just discovered that I can&#8217;t scroll within a frame. This means that I can&#8217;t edit—or even see—the text I&#8217;ve typed here. So I&#8217;ll have to trust that it&#8217;s ok. (It isn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve switched to my laptop, and have corrected a typo and fixed a missing markdown link.)</p>
<p>More often than not, I&#8217;ve got my laptop or my iPhone with me, and more often than not, the iPhone impresses me with its usefulness and size. Indeed, my relatively new iPhone 4 is the best piece of kit I think I&#8217;ve bought this year. It&#8217;s fast, the resolution is stupifying (I can finally read books on it without feeling eye-strain). Its battery life is great, and it replaces a camera, flip video recorder, sat nav, pad and paper and pen relatively painlessly. There are more dedicated apps for it than for the iPad, and they&#8217;re usually better. So the iPhone continues to impress me, and the iPad continues to fail to impress me. When I&#8217;m sat at home, coffee shop, or office, the Mac reliably does everything it&#8217;s possible to do, and is only slightly bigger than the iPad really.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I think the iPad is a terrible device; far from it. It is an impressive piece of kit, and its screen and speed and battery life are great. I do enjoy the times I&#8217;ve passed it around to show photos, for example. I was impressed that my two-year-old niece was able to make swirlly patterns on it, and she did it without needing any explaining. It&#8217;s great for consuming: for reading Kindle books and magazines and blogs and watching video. It&#8217;s got something fun about it, and did I mention that screen being brilliant?</p>
<p>So, I don&#8217;t understand tablets. I don&#8217;t get the desire to touch the thing you want to work on: your hand blocks what you&#8217;re looking at! It&#8217;s also awkward compared to a laptop which angles so you can see it and work at the same time. The iPad is constantly falling off, and its keyboard only makes sense if it&#8217;s mostly horisontal, making it difficult to see. The screen is so reflective that it&#8217;s useless out of doors, even in relatively sun-free Britain. They don&#8217;t multitask in the same way that a laptop does, and they&#8217;re not as portable as a smartphone.</p>
<p>So, unless a tablet is running a kick-ass operating system, is small enough to be truly portable and has thousands of dedicated applications written for it (hmm, sounds like an iPhone&#8230;), I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m sold.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/3470579652"><img class="alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/3470579652_ff14965e31_m.jpg?resize=240%2C180" alt="Wooden Kindle" width="240" height="180" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Ebooks are doing rather well, with Amazon announcing them outselling their <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/07/amazon-e-books-outsell-hardcovers/">print counterparts</a> in bestsellers lists. I&#8217;ve enjoyed using the Kindle app for various reasons including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant purchase/download (even Amazon Prime can take too long!)</li>
<li>One device, not many books</li>
<li>Reading in the dark (on the iPad, any way)</li>
<li>Searching and smart(ish) bookmarking</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I&#8217;d love to see various improvements, and a novel things I&#8217;m not sure I have a fully-formed idea around yet (I&#8217;d like new things with the power of computing devices, but I&#8217;m not sure yet what they might be.)</p>
<p>But something has interested me a lot with a piece I read in <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/5_ways_that_ebooks_are_better_than_paper_books.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>. The piece talks about various ways in which ebooks are better than paper ones, and it mentions &#8220;social highlighting&#8221;, that is: the ability to share electronically highlighted text and notes. Richard MacManus goes on to suggest better features and improvements, and I&#8217;m fully in agreement here: the social aspect of ebooks has yet to be developed much at all, it seems.</p>
<p>Now, these social tools could follow a very predictable path, taking in the evolution of social tools elsewhere: multi-site sharing options, tweets, facebook connecting (I &#8220;like&#8221; the Kite Runner) etc. No doubt they will. But the thing that really grabbed me was the <a href="http://kindle.amazon.com/popular_highlights">little gem of a site</a> showing the most highlighted passages in the Kindle bookstore. This means that Amazon knows what&#8217;s being highlighted. It means—I&#8217;m just guessing here—that publishers could begin to know how much books are actually read. You know that copy of A Brief History of Time you bought?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a very straightforward metric, but one that&#8217;s immediately useful to amazon, publishers, and authors. What else could be gleaned from vey simple and anonymous data like these?</p>
<p>What other data are Amazon using, and what else could be done with finer-grained data from users? Imagine language studies over tricky phrases in intralingual dictionaries! Finally, how can this be turned directly over to consumers?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to know my own reading patterns, which words and phrases I highlight.</p>
