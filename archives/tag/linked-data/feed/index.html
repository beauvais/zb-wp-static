								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>
  Every aspect of society and economy that has been touched by the Web has been changed radically. Even the way we interact socially is very different to 15 years ago. &#8230; These changes are being brought about by the Web’s ability to link documents together into a single information space. The Semantic Web extends this to link anything and as such the potential for radical change in our society is vast.
</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">–<em>Ian Davis—Nodalities 2nd Ed</em></p>
<p>Every week, I used to receive a few emails along these lines:</p>
<p><strong><em>Subject: Nodalities, I hope this is OK?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Hi Zach, I&#8217;ve attached my story for Nodalities, and would like to know what you think?</em></p>
<p><em>Best Regards,</em></p>
<p><em>Someone Awesome</em></p>
<p>For three years, I had the chance to read the stories of many of the Semantic Web&#8217;s most exciting developers before anyone else. I was allowed to tell them that I really enjoyed their story—and ask if we could cut it down from 5,000 words to a bit more like 1,000; you know, if you don&#8217;t mind?</p>
<p>Then, I would pull together a generous handful of these stories every couple months and ask our designers to put them between the thick, matte paper covers of what everyone in the office called Nodmag.</p>
<p>The magazine&#8217;s aim was to be the Semantic Web&#8217;s first regular industry publication. We were building a platform for sharing Linked Data and wanted to share news from across the whole industry. I had somehow ended up appearing in Nodalities&#8217; second edition as a co-author with <a title="Ian Davis" href="http://twitter.com/iand">Ian Davis,</a> discussing the Semantic Web as a blue-ocean opportunity.</p>
<p>Before the third issue, my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulMiller">Paul Miller</a> handed me the reigns, and I learned a hell of a lot in those first few months. I enjoyed asking people if they&#8217;d ever considered writing up their project in an article-like piece of prose. This in itself taught me much about collaborative projects, to see how many people were willing to put in extra time to write about their passion and share their skill. It also introduced me to some of the most articulate technologists, who often crystallised abstract and often staggeringly complicated ideas into a form anyone interested in the Web could appreciate.</p>
<p>Editing itself is something I found profoundly enjoyable, and I miss the chance to see the first version of an article, and to work through fixing punctuation and nudging syntax without altering the meaning – adding my own semantic layer to the semantic web. The most rewarding element was working with semantic web people who didn&#8217;t realize they <em>could</em> tell their story. With just a few nudges and hints, their enthusiasm won, and overpowered some restraints of self-conscious writing.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9084" data-permalink="https://beggingaquestion.com/archives/nodmag/editors-notes/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/editors-notes_zlkpci.png?fit=484%2C598&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="484,598" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="editors-notes" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/editors-notes_zlkpci.png?fit=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/editors-notes_zlkpci.png?fit=484%2C598&amp;ssl=1" class="alignleft wp-image-9084" title="editors-notes" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/editors-notes_zlkpci.png?w=1090" alt="semantic web editors notes" data-recalc-dims="1" />I absorbed a lot of information about linking data and applying web technologies, and watched the story unfold from a slightly removed position. Our first articles, for example, tended to look forward—expecting proof-of-concepts and apps in-the-wild.</p>
<p>Over time, the stories began to sound different in tone as they slowly shifted from expectation to sharing progress and discussing work underway. We also saw meticulous research from universities and science institutes. Although being a scholarly journal was beyond the general remit, many academics shared their findings with Nodalities&#8217; audience, kindly writing at a level even I could understand.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2011—amid some <a title="Talis sells library" href="http://www.information-age.com/talis-sells-off-library-software-business-to-focus-on-semantic-web-1607743/">big changes at Talis</a>—I took up the place as community manager in the data marketplace, Kasabi. As a startup, Kasabi really demanded full attention, and I could no longer commit to running the magazine. Also, despite doing the publishing several years, we had never pretended to be a proper publisher, and I had sincerely hoped Nodalities would be superseded by journalists whose coverage of our emerging industry should fare better than one blogging/community chap at a software company could do. So, I put together the last editor&#8217;s notes to appear next to a truly terrible portrait for the final issue in late spring, 2011.</p>
<p>I met incredibly interesting people, and editing is something I very much hope to have the chance to do again someday. I feel honoured to have been first to read these stories, and hope any influence I may have had didn&#8217;t get in the way of the developers&#8217; voices.</p>
<p>Last week, following Talis&#8217; major shift of direction, I felt nostalgic, and wanted to pour over some of the older copies of Nodmag. Alas, I found them missing. I&#8217;ve since heard that there are some plans to archive the site, and to have a home for the magazine somewhere, but in the meantime the back issues of Nodalities are available on github: <a title="Nodalites on Github" href="http://github.com/beauvais/nodalities">github.com/beauvais/nodalities</a>.</p>
<h3 id="edit-final-editors-notes">EDIT: Final Editor&#8217;s Notes</h3>
<hr />
<p>Nodalities has, for three years, told stories from around the ever-expanding sphere of Linked Data. As Editor, I have had the privilege of helping to tell those stories, to meet so many interesting people, and take part in the growth of the Linked Data community.</p>
<p>This will be Nodalities’ final edition.</p>
<p>At Talis, we have never been a media or publishing company&#8211;we build data platforms and applications&#8211;but Nodalities was created to help our community grow and give a voice to those joining and building with us. The magazine has fulfilled it’s purpose, and I am very happy for other media now to take responsibility for telling its stories.</p>
<p>As a final issue, I do not want to look back for context, but forward to new and emerging developments on the Web of Data. So, I have the added privilege of presenting a collection of stories with an emphasis on starting up for the final time.</p>
<p>If you would like to get in touch about any of these stories, or would like to catch up with me about what Talis is working on next, please feel free to contact me on zb@talis.com</p>
<p>Best,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p><a href=""><img class="alignleft" SRC="https://i2.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4050/4655579218_8fcde791d1_m.jpg?w=1090" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This is my first year attending the ESWC (formerly &#8220;European Semantic Web Conference&#8221; now the &#8220;Extended Semantic Web Conference,&#8221; cleverly, the acronym still works) near Heraklion on Crete. It&#8217;s only a couple days in, but I thought it&#8217;d be a good time to report back to the Nodalities readers. ESWC is a gathering of some of the world&#8217;s most influential Semantic Web thinkers, and for me It&#8217;s been a few days of meeting people in the flesh with whom I&#8217;ve been in touch online for years. As one bloke put it: &#8220;What&#8217;s kept you away?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m extremely glad I&#8217;ve not been kept away this year, and have been excited to see what&#8217;s been built recently. ESWC is a very academic conference; indeed I&#8217;m quietly auditing the PhD Symposium as I type this. There are papers, PhD symposia, demos and expositions on topics covering anything from ontology development to MapReduce processing of RDF triples. It seems a very fertile seedbed, with many of these ideas having the potential of growing into projects, startups, papers and possibly industries. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a subtle and largely subconscious transition by blogging mostly about projects that are up and running. This has been important because the Semantic Web world is no longer one of &#8220;someday,&#8221; but a world of current and continuous activity. So, I&#8217;ve talked about visualisations of data, products running on Linked Data, data.gov.uk et.al.; and I&#8217;ve held back on discussing purely possible. It&#8217;s been exciting and uplifting to see the conceptual evolve to the proven and working. But this is a reflection of progress—of moving from hypothesis to implementation. It doesn&#8217;t mean the concepts have stopped flowing. It&#8217;d be a very short story in the history of human communication if the Semantic Web has used up all of its possibilities in ten years! </p>
<p>ESWC is a little microcosm of the wider research going on in Linked Data and related fields. It seems to me that Big Ideas need the traditional frameworks of academic investigation. Questions need to be asked and answered and debated and tried and broken and rebuilt. Much of this science will not become technology, and this is wholly acceptable because it gives the Big Ideas a lot of scope to be refined. </p>
<p>ESWC is just such a place. PhD students and researchers fill the schedule with proposals and reports, and many possibilities are being constantly debated around coffee, beer, and the beach. It&#8217;s been a thoroughly fascinating few days, and I&#8217;m very much looking forward to more over the next few.</p>
<p>As a quick note, Talis sponsored the Scripting for the Semantic Web challenge for this, its final year. Alexandre Passant and Pablo Mendes won the prize with SPARQLpush.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post was originally published on Nodalities Blog.</em></p>
<p>The Talis offices, for the past few weeks, have been awash with geeky excitement—that kind of near giddy excitement that comes with eager expectation. We&#8217;ve all been waiting for something important.</p>
<p>For some, this was no doubt augmented with the announcement of Steve&#8217;s new <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/apple-ipad-future">iPad</a>; but that&#8217;s not what&#8217;s gotten us all worked up.</p>
<p>For months, we&#8217;ve been looking forward to the launch of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a>; and last week, the wraps finally came off. The official press release put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>A major new website has been launched to the public which gives anyone who wants to use it unprecedented and free access to government data in one place.</p></blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t quite capture the coolness of the launch, for me. Yes, it&#8217;s a major new website, and it&#8217;s point is to publish information. But, the exciting thing is that this information is being published as data: data that can be used, reused, remixed and enriched. Sir Tim Berners-Lee&#8217;s perspective was more exciting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Making public data available for re-use is about increasing accountability and transparency and letting people create new, innovative ways of using it. Government data should be a public resource. By releasing it, we can unlock new ideas for delivering public services, help communities and society work better, and let talented entrepreneurs and engineers create new businesses and services.</p></blockquote>
<p>The point is that this public resource is finally getting a home on the web, and an infrastructure to make it not just available, but useful.</p>
<p>The exceptional team behind data.gov.uk have striven to adhere to web standards in its production: including Linked Data as a priority, as Professor Nigel Shadbolt explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are also going to increase the use of ‘Linked Data’ standards, which allows people to provide data in a way that is as flexible and easy-to-use as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in November, Leigh Dodds wrote a post explaining how we&#8217;ve been involved, and there&#8217;s an official Talis Platform <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/news">press release</a> too. Basically, we&#8217;ve been working with the data.gov.uk team to help with the Linked Data part of the site—hosting the SPARQL endpoints and providing consultancy and training, for example.</p>
<p>I can confidently say that we&#8217;re very proud of data.gov.uk, the team behind it, and our involvement with it. We&#8217;re excited by the prospect of this data being used as raw material for clever people to make interesting, useful, even world-changing things with it. We&#8217;ve seen the beginnings and proof-of-concept projects already.</p>
<p>Now comes the really exciting stuff. What are you going to build?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>|This article first appeared in Nodalities Magazine, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2">CC By + SA</a></strong></p>
<p>For anyone following the Nodalities blog, you may have read some of my recent posts discussing the trends boiling up around Web 3.0 (other buzzwords are available). The Mobile Web and upgraded connectivity in general; the rise of ubiquitous computing from chips in every product imaginable; Linked Data and the “Semantic Web” as an organising platform for this rising tide of data—these are three very broad trends seeing a lot of media attention presently. From where I’m standing, I tend to see the next great turning point of the Web as a convergence of some of these trends, and see it as a rise in the importance of and reliance upon data itself and data tools generally.</p>
<p>The mobile web is bringing new sorts of information to people, and they can make use of this info wherever they happen to be because of advances in devices ad connectivity. As phones and web-enabled devices get better, so to do the chips we seem to have embedded all over the place, and we can now begin to have a more clear picture of what we do through the information we gather from our heaters, cars, and pedometers. Also, as more objects become connected, the grunt-work of number-crunching and storage is becoming commoditised into big, efficient, utility-like cloud services, which host and work with our collected information much more effectively than the gadget in your hand could ever hope to do. Others, like us here at Talis, talk about the Semantic Web, which allows for an evolution from a bunch of connected documents to the explicit connections between bits of information.</p>
<p>Also fermenting in this mix is a strengthening trend of political transparency and a public, shared ownership of social data. Barack Obama’s new administration has clearly made this a priority with the launch and work around data.gov; and in the UK, Sir Tim Berners-Lee himself has been appointed to an Parliamentary advisory role. There is growing pressure to be able to have access to public data, and to see it as belonging to the nation’s people rather than allowed to be legitimately filed away in the great, locked bureau of the capitols.</p>
<p>So, picking up two fairly obvious trends here: Social, Public Data and Linked Data; it would seem to follow that people would begin to have access to previously unavailable information in usable, linked forms. And it’s certainly beginning, as articles elsewhere in this magazine have illustrated. But, what about other chunks of public data? What about when data comes from universities, institutions, scientific foundations and NGO’s? What about charities monitoring crime, CO2 emissions and family histories? Wouldn’t these make a useful piece in the web of social data? What resources have the governments themselves got, if they want to make their public-owned data available in a useful format?</p>
<p>These questions form a major part of the thinking behind Talis’ Connected Commons initiative (talis.com/cc). Basically, Talis has made its Semantic Web platform (including data hosting and access tools) available free of charge for any datasets made available to the public. In doing so, we’re hoping to remove the barrier of cost entirely to publishing interesting data in a Linked Data way. One major reason for this is to promote reuse and mashups of this interesting data, and for people to be able to “follow their noses” to the data that completes their projects. But, from a publishers’ perspective, this is important, because it’s removing a major reason not to bother with making data useful, if not only public. So, with this, data can be made public and useable and the developers and users get the benefit of public SPARQL endpoints and API access to interesting data.</p>
<p>To keep the data open and public, datasets need to make use of either the Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) or Creative Commons’ CC0 license. Ian Davis, in his article in this magazine, explains more about waivers and the Connected Commons, and there is a lot more about this particular initiative over on the Talis site (talis.com/platform/cc/faqs/).</p>
<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Sir Tim said: “This is our data. This is our taxpayers’ money which has created this data, so I would like to be able to see it, please.” I wonder if initiatives such as Connected Commons will begin to remove excuses, hindrances, and obstacles? As public awareness of the importance of access gets hotter, this might become a political issue, as well as a pragmatic one. I hope that in the rush to publish data, and in the ensuing discussion and debate that follows, that the users, hackers and developers don’t get sidelined. I think the world is ready for its data back.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p><a class="alignleft" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/l"><img style="margin-right: 5px" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/3029256542_0d6b8871e7_m.jpg?w=1090" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It&#8217;s hardly new for this blog or our community to cover issues of open access and making information useful for users. But, what if we were to begin speaking in terms  such as: &#8220;A call for transparency,&#8221; or subtly replace <em>user</em> with <em>citizen</em>?  With little substantive shift of core meaning, the whole message becomes one of rights, responsibilities, and public duty.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been watching this week as the ember at the heart of this dialogue has been fanned with air-time on mainstream media, and is about to receive its fuel. First, UK Prime Minister Gorden Brown asked Sir Tim Berners-Lee  &#8220;to help us drive the opening up of access to Government data in the web over the coming months&#8221; appointing him to a special role advising Parliament. In an <a title="interview audio" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8096793.stm">interview</a> with BBC tech correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, Sir Tim discussed his position; explaining that he&#8217;s pushing for transparency: &#8220;This is our data. This is our taxpayers&#8217; money which has created this data, so I would like to be able to see it, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Tim had the audience at the <a title="TED Talk, Sir Tim Berners-Lee" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html">tech-friendly TED</a> conference chanting &#8220;Raw Data Now&#8221; back in February, and he&#8217;s now been invited by a sitting government leader to make this happen.</p>
<p>This week also saw the publication of the <a title="Digital Britain PDF—made available via bbc.co.uk" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/16_06_09digitalbritain.pdf">Digital Britain</a> report, outlining Parliament&#8217;s plans for a more connected future. I must admit, for the record, that I haven&#8217;t read all 239 pages of the report (made available via bbc.co.uk), rather, I&#8217;ve skimmed it and read several overviews. The gist seems to be that the UK plans to invest in the future of its citizens&#8217; internet connectivity, upgrading existing infrastructure and providing access where there currently isn&#8217;t. This investment will cover both wired broadband provision (with a stated aim of 2MBps minimum for every household) and wireless, encouraging investment in 3g provision by allowing mobile companies to have their network licenses more permanently.  It recommends subsidising development wherever the market can&#8217;t provide; seemingly equating net access with public utilities (The PM further <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/article6506136.ece">clarified his thought</a>s by saying the Internet is as vital as water or gas). More information on this report can be found on the summary page at the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/digital-britain">Guardian</a>, on twitter: hashtag #digitalbritain, and Bill Thompson&#8217;s tech-centric <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/digital-britain-engaging-with-the-internet">overview</a>.</p>
<p>All this week needs is a major announcement of something moving entirely to cloud-computing to look a bit like the convergence I blogged about a few days ago ;).</p>
<p>So, what has this incredible week brought us? It&#8217;s a governmental lead on opening up access to data. Their appointment of TBL makes me think that it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;ll see more and more linked-data projects coming from the public sector (not just access to, but usable, linked data). Over the next few years, the UK plans to improve its infrastructure and incentivize development on communications networks, and they&#8217;ve begun to use language suggesting that being part of the network and access to Public data are rights issues.</p>
<p>Sir Tim spoke, in the interview, about beginning with low-hanging fruit: pilot schemes which open up data and watch what happens.</p>
<p>What are you building?</p>

Innovation, if you like, occurs at the join between ideas when they connect. I see this as fundamental to the way ideas and their applications (technology) advance. I tend to believe that anything &#8220;novel&#8221; is actually affected when other ideas are connected together.</p>
<p>In the technological world, this seems like a strong analogy for Linked Data: information which can be connected by a web-like network of links. These Linked Data have become the foundation for what has come to be known as the “Semantic Web”, a web of connected information which breaks out of information silos and enables the discovery of new ideas from old, and innovation from existing information. We use the phrase &#8220;serendipitous reuse&#8221; for the idea that once an idea (or a piece of data) is published, it can be used and reused in novel ways and in context of other data to produce unexpected, and unforeseeable possibilities. These ideas (data, again) become increasingly useful when published in a format which allows them to be linked freely to ANY other piece of information. We&#8217;ve had the distribution method for this network for years (the good, ol WWW itself) and it&#8217;s been about a year since  RDF was launched by the WWW Consortium to handle the data itself. The idea is basically to give every bit of data an address (a universal address, not one subjective to a database like a cell reference), and to predicate that bit of information very much like language does. If you think of it like a language, RDF lets bits of data (nouns) to be acted upon or act upon (verbs) others (other nouns). This triple-format enables a near infinite recombination (theoretically) of any data, anywhere with an address.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the problem? Well, most of the world&#8217;s data are locked away in silos (prisoners of the cells their databases confine them to). Many organisations may wish to make use of their data in a semantic environment, and many might even embrace the Open-source nature of their data, and make it freely available to the world to recombine and use: there are always more innovations outside an organisation than within! In order to lower barriers to enter this linked data world, Talis has built a Platform with resources to host and utilise these connections, making use of semantic web standards (RDF and SPARQL, the query language of the semantic web) and a developer-friendly environment (a RESTFul API, for example).</p>
<p>However, this innovation is only possible when data are accessible. In order to further lower the barriers, Talis is now offering free access to the Platform to host public domain data. We are calling this initiative the Talis Connected Commons, and the offer is not limited to free hosting: the data access services, including access to a public SPARQL endpoint, are also freely available. To keep this data open, you will need to use either the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/1">Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License</a> or the recently launched <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/zero">Creative Commons CC0 license</a> to publish data. Anyone will then be able to freely access the stored data using the Platform services, without API keys and without usage limits.</p>
