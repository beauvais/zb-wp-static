								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple weeks ago, I wrote to my MP to raise concern for the so-called &#8220;washup&#8221; of last-minute legislation being used to push through the now highly-controversial &#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/digital-economy-bill">Digital Economy Bill</a>.&#8221; </p>
<p>My reasons to write are several, and I will devote some more time to explain these later, but wanted to post my MP&#8217;s response verbatim (my address removed only.)</p>
<p>###<br />
Philip Dunne, MP Ludlow</p>
<p>23rd March 2010</p>
<p>Dear Zach,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email of March 17th regarding extreme internet laws.</p>
<p>For nearly twelve years, the Government has neglected this crucial area of our economy. We believe a huge amount needs to be done to give the UK a modern regulatory environment for the digital and creative industries. Whilst we welcome aspects of the bill there are other areas of great concern to us.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that Britain has the most favourable intellectual framework in the world for innovators, digital content creators and high tech businesses. We recognise the need to tackle digital piracy and make it possible for people to buy and sell digital intellectual property online. However, it is vital that any anti-piracy measures promote new business models rather than holding innovation back. THis must not be about propping up existing business models but creating an environment that allows new ones to develop. That is why we were opposed to original clause 17 and are still opposed to clause 29 which props up ITV regional news with BBC License Fee payers money.</p>
<p>The Government&#8217;s failure to introduce the Bill until the eleventh hour of this Parliament has given rise to considerable concern that we no longer have the time to scrutinise the many controversial and detailed measures outlined in their proposals. We fully appreciate these concerns. However in certain areas, including measures to allow website blocking in certain carefully proscribed circumstances, there has been substantial debate in the House of Lords. I also believe they should be debated in the House of Commons before we agree to them. Only if we are confident that they have been given scrutiny that they deserve will we support them.</p>
<p>IT is also worth pointing out that many of the fears about the Bill&#8217;s proposals are not entirely accurate. People won&#8217;t be discunnected from the internet without due process. And it will only be a small minority of people who consistently infringe copyright who are disconnected, not the average person who happens to have done so once or twice. Even then, they may be able to reconnect using another ISP immediately and without penalty.</p>
<p>Please rest assured that my colleagues in the Shadow Culture, Media and Sport and Shadow Business, Innovation and Skills teams will do everything in their power to work towards legislation that strengthens our digital sector and provides the security that our businesses and consumers so desperately need.</p>
<p>Thank you again for taking the time to get in touch.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Philip Dunne<br />
MP for Ludlow</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m introducing old friends; but <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> is a &#8220;microbloggiing&#8221; platform, to give it its proper description. it gives users 140 characters to publish status updates, comments, gripes, complaints, praises, news and whatever comes to mind. It&#8217;s burst out of its original answer to the simple question: &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; and users often tweet just about everything.</p>
<p>One interesting innovation is the integration of the hashtag. Simply a hash symbol (#) and a tag descriptor for the comment. This gives people the ability to follow particular threads of updates or participate in conversations around an interest. They&#8217;re often used, for example, to update the goings on from conferences (#FOWA for example). People give their own content this little bit of information, and a search engine can find them. People can add additional information and follow conventions which allow for distributed trends that anyone can follow and interact with.</p>
<p>The recent snowfall in Britain gave rise to a flurry of tweets about road closures, amounts of snow falling, schools closing down and all the other chaos unleashed. When users followed a simple convention, however, this information got organised. People quickly adopted the #uksnow hashtag to track the topic; and eventually someone worked out a way to capture all the info needed to follow these geographically. By tweeting the first half of a UK post code plus a rating out of ten snowfall, anyone following the thread knows exactly where it&#8217;s snowing. It&#8217;s like an instant weather polling station, distributed across the country. It can go a step further, however, when services can actually mashup these tweets when users turn their simple status updates into a mini line of code.</p>
<p>This little bit of information allows for people to write software to track and automate the twitter information. This <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/snow">interactive map</a> from benmarsh.co.uk, for example, actually plots a visual graph of snowfall across Britain. Bigger snowflakes indicate larger numbers out of ten in the poll. It&#8217;s simple, really. Ingenious, possibly. But the fundamental distinction between this tracking ability and the noise of thousands of Twits shouting about the snow is that little bit of metadata.</p>
<p>So, is this use of twitter a metaphor for the Semantic Web? It&#8217;s certainly a picture of automating information flow using metadata via software. Sounds Semanticcy to me.</p>

In France, I had the misfortune of being almost completely without the ability to smell or taste anything thanks to a lingering cold which also incapacitated me on the final Friday of the trip. Our French hosts cooked us a wonderful (looking) local meal complete with regional wines, and every mouthful tasted exactly the same. According to Wendy, this stood me in good stead for Amsterdam, however, since I wasn&#8217;t as bothered by all the smoldering plant material hovering in the air.</p>
<p>Amsterdam, as previously mentioned, is a lovely city. It is very accessible and its scale lends itself to walking. It&#8217;s easy to find somewhere pleasant to drink coffee or eat from a huge variety of restaurants. It is slightly unhelpful, however, that nearly every place at which you can eat or drink is called a &#8216;cafe&#8217;. This includes bars, coffee houses, sandwitch shops, pubs&#8230; literally everything that doesn&#8217;t sell cannabis is a cafe. Many &#8216;cafes&#8217; also sell an astonishing selection of lagers, which I could only imagine drinking on the continent.</p>
<p>The streets meander pleasantly, and it&#8217;s not too well-planned; so it&#8217;s possible to stumble across a brilliant cafe (of whatever description) nearly anywhere. The streets seem to be used almost like common land, however, by the walkers, cyclists and motorists in town. Cars seem to give way most of the time, and trams could appear just about everywhere, from any direction. Bicycles literally litter every available upright in Amsterdam, and if you don&#8217;t move sharpish at the sound of a bell you&#8217;re likely to adorn a lamppost or bollard yourself. I spent much of my time waiting for the imagined &#8216;zzhhrip&#8217; sound of bicycle-tyre on raincoat which I&#8217;m pretty certain would almost immediately proceed a rear-end collision.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#8217;m glad to be back in Britain. Something about seeing the hills and green of near-home yesterday was incredibly comforting.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:70de8c8b-e723-4faa-8a38-1fe258747336" class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="display: inline; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Blogging about politics can be a bit of a mixed bag, so we&#8217;ll see how it goes. I want to avoid polarising talk, tabloid tactics, and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt). Instead, I&#8217;d like to discuss the latest raft of changes which seek to make immigrants &#8216;more British&#8217; before offering them citizenship.</div>
<h2>Personal Perspective</h2>
<p>First, and as a matter of context: I am an immigrant. I was born and raised in Colorado, USA, and have lived in the UK for the last 5 years or so. My national identity, however, is a more complicated matter. I resonate politically better with Britain than the United States. I admire more British personages than American (probably due to the fact that the only great Americans I can think to name are either dead or long dead&#8230;). I laugh at British comedians, and listen to Radio 4. I queue. I share the occasional withering glance  with my fellow public transport passengers whenever a tourist declares loudly that something is cute or quaint. I even say: &#8220;Oh, excuse me, sorry&#8221; when someone else runs into me at Sainsburys, and I say &#8220;Cheers&#8221; or &#8220;Ta&#8221; even when someone should be thanking me.</p>
<p>This has put me in an interesting position at times. I have been part of conversations when the other party doesn&#8217;t actually know, or momentarily forgets, that I grew up singing <em>The Star-Spangled Banner</em> before watching baseball.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think Americans are rude and ignorant&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re always going on about how small everything is and they don&#8217;t know where Somerset is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know where Somerset is, and I have been asked where Shropshire is by Londoners,&#8221; I reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you&#8217;re different. You&#8217;re not really American. You don&#8217;t have an accent&#8230; and you&#8217;re don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m cute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite&#8221;</p>
<h2>Immigration in the UK</h2>
<p>I get the feeling that many mainstream British ideas are fairly far removed from immigrants as people. There is a distinct <em>themness</em> about immigrants, and I think this notion is exploited by politicians and commentators who have to justify their cynical existences. Over the past five years, I have learned that immigration is ranked among education and health in the national psyche, and politicians who <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">want</span> need to be seen <em>doing something</em> can easily turn to immigration policy for support. This national concern for immigration is baffling.  According to the National Statistics Office, less than 10% of the UK population were foreign born in 2006. (In the US, for the same year the number was nearly 14%). So, less than one in ten people in the UK are foreign born, and even fewer of those have recourse to public funds, yet this ranks among Education and Health?</p>
<p>I can see that there is cause for thought, cause for discussion, but not cause for concern. A study for the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/www.oecd.org" target="_blank">OECD</a> stated: “the ratio of immigrants (no matter how defined) has grown steadily in all Western European countries considered, except Belgium.”<em>1</em> So, immigration is definitely on the rise, and I don&#8217;t debate that. However, most of them have the sense not to move to Belgium so they can&#8217;t be all bad. The flip side of this is that immigration has actually increased the UK economic growth rate, according to the TUC. There is, I feel, cause for concern in that the general public does not understand immigration all that well as outlined by a brilliant article from the sometimes-inflammatory <em>Independent</em>: &#8220;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/lies-damned-lies-and-immigration-412885.html" target="_blank">Lies, Damned Lies and Immigration</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Now, what has really got me angry is the new scheme from Jacqui Smith, Home Secretary, that immigrants will have to work harder to &#8220;earn their right to become UK citizens&#8221;.  (Press Coverage: <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/nmigrant120.xml" target="_blank"><em>Telegraph</em></a>, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/immigrationpolicy.immigration" target="_blank"><em>Guardian</em></a>, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/article3399454.ece" target="_blank"><em>Times</em></a> and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/7254926.stm" target="_blank">BBC</a>) and it includes increasing the time before a migrant can be naturalised and an increased fee. Gordon Brown has also mentioned, according to Radio 4 reports and the Times (see link above) that immigrants should have to undertake community service to be introduced to the British Way of Life.</p>
<p>Let me explore that a bit:</p>
<h4>Money</h4>
<p>It costs a fortune to immigrate to the UK. I am American, and chose to move to the UK for love &#8211;my wife is British. I like it here, but it is an expensive place to live. Tax is high, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/article3407757.ece" target="_blank">services are expensive</a>, and it is required of an Immigrant to pay large sums of money every few years. I should mention that I have been paying UK income tax  and national insurance despite being unable to access public funds for some of my immigration journey and that I attended a UK university after marrying and immigrating, and paid full fees (during the time, around £9k/year) so none of my education was subsidised by any taxes I have paid.</p>
<p>The cost of visas and fees is high, indeed. There is a cost for the initial visiting Visa to get married (currently £500) which lets you stay here for 6 months, without recourse to public funds. You then must apply for temporary residency (£395) which lasts for a couple years. Then, if you want indefinite leave to remain (and if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll need to sort out alternative accommodation fast) it will cost you £750. I&#8217;ve paid each of them, one after the other every few  months or years. The total: £<strong>1645</strong>, and I&#8217;m still not a citizen. If I want to become one, I still have to pay <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/bookstore.asp?trackid=001261&amp;FO=1240167" target="_blank">£9.99 for a book on what it means to be British</a> (Ha!), £<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/www.lifeintheuktest.gov.uk" target="_blank">34 to take a citizenship test</a> (<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/article584918.ece" target="_blank">which most UK citizens can&#8217;t actually pass</a>) <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/cost" target="_blank">and a massive £655 for the application</a>. Then I&#8217;d be invited to attend a citizenship ceremony at which I will be required to pledge an oath, and I haven&#8217;t found out if that costs me more yet&#8230; new total? <strong>£2343.99,</strong> and Jacqui Smith wants more. I see this as a combination of four distinct ideas, blended in a dangerous cocktail:</p>
<ul>
<li>A genuine need for money to run immigration services</li>
<li>A cash-cow for a cash-greedy government</li>
<li>A political scapegoat for opportunistic political figures</li>
<li>A Protection Racket, where people who are legally seeking residence are exploited with the threat of having their life plans crushed</li>
</ul>
<h3>British Way of Life</h3>
<p>What, exactly did Gordon Brown mean when he said he was thinking of having immigrants doing more in the community? I am assuming he did not mean most of the plumbing, or supplementing the taxes for an aging population. For clarity, let me say that these proposed changes will have no effect on the most discussed group of migrants: Eastern Europeans. They already have access to the country through the EU and do not need to pay all the clearance fees. So, making all the non EU migrants do community service will help them to understand what it means to be British? I would have thought a crash-course in happy slapping or under-aged drinking would have been more apt. How many British people do you know who do community service?The most illuminating illustration I heard about the preposterousness of this was a commentator on Radio 4 who pointed out that Abu Hamza (hook-handed, one-eyed favourite of the <em>Sun</em> headlines and controversial fundamentalist cleric of Finsbury Park mosque) could have been said to have been active in his community, and undertook volunteer work. Gordon Brown&#8217;s government has already implemented a Britishness test (see link in previous paragraph) which is so patronising and oblique I don&#8217;t know what it is for. Some of the facts you are expected to know (Taken directly off the test site):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where have migrants come from in the past and why? What sort of work have they done?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do women have equal rights in voting, education and work, and has this always been the case?</strong> <em>(What does this have to do with Britishness? Do we need to know that we were tardy giving women the vote, that there is still a disgraceful gender pay gap or that women are under-represented in all aspects of public society? Surely we don&#8217;t want Migrants thinking about that too much?)</em></li>
<li><strong>When do children take tests at school? How many go on to higher education?</strong> <em>(This changes every couple years, drastically.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Do many children live in single parent families or step-families?</strong> <em>(Any ideas? Have a guess&#8230;</em><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/nugget.asp?id=348" target="_blank"><em>2,672,000</em></a><em> dependent children in single parent families, according to the National Statistics Office. Bet you didn&#8217;t know that.)</em></li>
<li><strong>How many people belong to an ethnic minority and which are the largest minority groups? Where are there large ethnic communities? </strong></li>
<li>And finally, my favourite: <strong>Where are Geordie, Cockney and Scouse dialects spoken?</strong> <em>(I&#8217;d have said North London, where you can hear quite a few more than that, just on one street!)</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Finally, Timing</h3>
<p>Is one extra year without citizenship going to make any difference to society? The people who want to become citizens have already been inundated with extortionate fees, made to feel unwelcome, and made to wait for more than 5 years for a passport and the right to vote. These people are already here, and cannot have broken any residence laws anyway. It will not effect illegal immigrants, assylum seekers, EU Immigrants, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/nondomtax?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront" target="_blank">Non-doms</a> (stupid name that sounds like <em>condom</em> every time a news-reader says it!) or terrorists. They will have been working and paying tax, and are likely to work in jobs not filled by Britain&#8217;s workforce anyway (According to TUC report). One more year without representation or a passport  is an easy way for Jacqui Smith to appear tougher on immigration without changing the numbers at all. It is a meaningless gesture, which only benefits a small number of wealthy politicians seeking to look tough and adds months of difficulty for normal people.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know this is behind the game, and that the bleeding edge of blog reviews has moved well beyond online streaming service Hulu (even though it&#8217;s not yet out to the public). But I received my beta invite last week and have had all this time to play around with it.</p>
<p>My initial thoughts: none.</p>
<p>No, not one initial thought. Hulu doesn&#8217;t work in the UK. They don&#8217;t tell you: &#8220;Hey, if you live in the UK, you will be able to access and begin your Hulu experience, but when you choose a show to stream, you&#8217;ll be disappointed. Have a nice day.&#8221; You have to jump through all the Beta hoops to get there first.</p>
<p>Now, I know I should have known better, being a generally web-savvy chap. But after a few pre-reviews of the Hulu service, I decided not to read any more blogs about it until after I&#8217;d tried it out myself. I knew not to expect too much, after reading the last review over at <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hulu-news-corp-and-the-web-2-0">Between the Lines</a> , but I wanted my own experience.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve found dozens of blogs about how bad it is that Hulu <a>doesn&#8217;t work in Europe</a>. Aside from whingeing about the lack of support, I can&#8217;t really think of anything more to write about Hulu (apart from its ridiculous, trying-too-hard-for-the-Web-2.0-market <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hulu-news-corp-and-the-web-2-0">name</a>).</p>
<p>But, doesn&#8217;t this kind of go against point of the web? The idea that we can make connections, share content, stream and connect?</p>
<p>The principle of the internet is broken by this experiment, and I don&#8217;t think a platform intended to be a YouTube killer should ever have been trialled in a geographically-limited network. Sure, I understand private Betas, but why limit this to the States? I don&#8217;t think News Corp really gets the Web 2.0 thing. In fact, I wonder if they really <i>get </i>the internet?</p>
<p>It reminds me of LaunchCast (now Yahoo Music). When I first launched the player, all the content was free, and there was absolutely loads of it. I was thrilled! Over months, however, content became harder to find due to advertisement interruptions and restrictions on skipping tracks. Suddenly, Launch re-directed to Yahoo, and I could no longer skip any content without upgrading to a premium service which hadn&#8217;t existed before. Then, when I moved to Britain, all the content was unavailable apart from a limited selection which I can only presume was intended for a British audience. (Don&#8217;t think my mates here would have agreed in a focus group!)</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used a yahoo service since. No, seriously, I haven&#8217;t used Yahoo. As soon as Konfabulator was purchased by Yahoo, I uninstalled it. I was all set to set up a Flickr account, when I found out it was Yahoo. (I might go back on that one, once I get a decent digital camera.)</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t really a boycott so much as a pre-emptive decision. I know that as soon as Yahoo gets a hold of a service, its user-friendliness will dissolve into advertisements and &#8216;premium services&#8217; (a contradiction in terms!) This is what Hulu reminds me of. An attempt at grabbing a market instead of a well-thought-out startup trying to sell a genuinely good service and make a profit on its quality.</p>
<p>What is Web 2.0? Hulu doesn&#8217;t know, and it makes me think that News Corp hasn&#8217;t really got its head round it at all. I shudder to think <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/news-corp-looking-to-buy-linkedin">what&#8217;s going to happen with LinkedIn</a>.</p>
