Every caller I&#8217;ve heard has complained, and is scared about their data. My own reaction is conflicted.</p>
<p>I used to work as an evangelist for a company that advocated open data. I believe that opening up data tends to enable progress. You know that quick-fire game where you say the first thing that comes to mind? If you said: &#8220;open data,&#8221;</p>
<p>I would say: &#8220;accountable government,&#8221; or &#8220;better research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, I would probably say: &#8220;wait, what?&#8221; – I&#8217;m not as eloquent in real life without a text editor.</p>
<p>Also, a hero of mine, Ben Goldacre, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/nhs-plan-share-medical-data-save-lives?CMP=twt_gu">wrote about care.data</a>, pointing out that this data could absolutely save lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We learn how to save lives by studying huge datasets on the medical histories of millions of people. This information helps us identify the causes of cancer and heart disease; it helps us to spot side-effects from beneficial treatments, and switch patients to the safest drugs; it helps us spot failing hospitals, or rubbish surgeons; and it helps us spot the areas of greatest need in the NHS.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He highlights some of my conflict by saying that there are problems with the way the scheme has been launched, and it hasn&#8217;t taken into consideration the concerns we have about privacy, security and access. Dr. Goldacre concludes that we should watch and wait before opting out.</p>
<p>But I have decided to opt out of care.data, and tweeted about it quite strongly.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you haven&#39;t faxed your GP yet to opt out of care.data, then read this. Then Opt Out! (<a href="https://twitter.com/FaxYourGP">@FaxYourGP</a>) <a href="http://t.co/tbWMtaQlTx">http://t.co/tbWMtaQlTx</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Zach Beauvais (@beauvais) <a href="https://twitter.com/beauvais/status/437914135347871744">February 24, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This is why.</p>
<h2>They haven&#8217;t told me enough about who gets access to my private, medical information.</h2>
<p>All the information you need to make your decision about whether you want to opt out of care.data is in a leaflet (link to pdf). And it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We will use information such as your postcode and NHS number to link your records from these different places. Records are linked in a secure system so your identity is protected.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We sometimes release confidential information to approved researchers, if this is allowed by law and meets the strict rules that are in place to protect your privacy.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, wait: Who are these researchers? When has this happened in the past? Who are the researchers you have in mind for the future? If I find out you&#8217;ve sold a bunch of care.data to a private company, will I be able to opt out then?</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t say.</p>
<p>In other news, <strong><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hospital-records-nhs-patients-insurance">The NHS sold health record information to a big insurance company</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Goldacre talks about health insurance concerns with care.data being a bit of a red herring. If you have private health insurance, you give them access to your records anyway. Right, but this is a different kettle of herring. I don&#8217;t trust the NHS not to sell this data to companies who exist to make a profit – because that is a fundamental conflict of interest. I don&#8217;t have a problem giving my own medical insurer (disclosure: I haven&#8217;t got any private health insurance) my medical history. But I <em>do</em> have a problem giving an unknown corporation access to my info.</p>
<h2>Care.data risks are not laid out.</h2>
<p>Information will be &#8220;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Pseudonymity">pseudonymised</a>,&#8221; which means that each record will be given a fake name. So Joe Bloggs will have the same medical history as me, but won&#8217;t be called Zach.</p>
<p>But, pseudonymised data has risks <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Inference_attack">(read about inference attacks)</a>. It is possible (and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AOL_search_data_scandal">it&#8217;s been done</a>) to work out the link between a pseudo-human and a real person.</p>
<p>I also wonder what the leaflet says it will do to make sure the data is securely stored. Hmm&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We are very careful with the information and we follow strict rules about how it is stored and used, and have a thorough process that must be followed before any information can be shared.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, that&#8217;s fine then. They promise to be careful with it.</p>
<p>So, I have a quick search for &#8220;NHS data leak.&#8221; What I find is <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/technology-23286231">story</a> after <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/nhs-trust-fined-175000-over-data-leak-7000002198">story</a> of bad things done with data by the NHS.</p>
<p>Is this a fair assessment? No. It&#8217;s a search of news stories using a leading query. Sorry. But I want to know about this. I want to know how the NHS will keep care.data safe, secure and out of the hands of unknown people.</p>
<p>From the way I understand it, the risks of data breaches or inference attacks tend to be small for most individuals. But they are not covered by the NHS Leaflet.</p>
<h2>Opting out is the only stone I have to throw, isn&#8217;t it?</h2>
<p>I want the NHS to look at its data more thoroughly. I want them to be able to do deep, important meta-analyses on health records, outcomes and practices. I want them to save lives through data.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t trust the way they&#8217;ve set up this scheme, and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a better option than to opt out.</p>
<p>The scheme to put the data online has been <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/health-26239532">delayed for 6 months</a>, following criticism from some important bodies (like The Royal College of GPs, the British Medical Association and patient watchdog Healthwatch England).</p>
<p>Dr. Goldacre asks us to hold fire on opting out. Wait until closer to the time, and see what happens. But I&#8217;m not a GP (Ben is), I&#8217;m not a columnist (ditto), nor am I a member of a watchdog (I don&#8217;t think owning a spaniel counts, right?) I feel that my opt-out is as close to a protest vote as I&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>Alongside this, a lot of people will forget to re-open the issue in 6 months. <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Politics_of_memory">People collectively forget things</a> – even important things. I think waiting is a bad idea because of this.</p>
<p>So, I used <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/www.faxyourgp.com">Fax Your GP</a> to opt out.</p>
<p id="update"><strong>Update, it looks like Ben Goldacre thinks it&#8217;s too much of a mess now.</strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">That really is the end of it for me. If <a href="https://twitter.com/hscic">@HSCIC</a> are still hiding info on what went wrong, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/caredata?src=hash">#caredata</a> is unsupportable <a href="http://t.co/5xPQ3dbTN3">http://t.co/5xPQ3dbTN3</a></p>
