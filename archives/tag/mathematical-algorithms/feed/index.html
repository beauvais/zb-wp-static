<p>I have talked a lot about metaphor, both here and, perhaps sadly, to my friends and family. Metaphor and the abstract are true passions of mine, and I can&#8217;t help but see them everywhere. I suppose, it&#8217;s the nature of metaphor to <em>be</em> everywhere, really.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one thing in terms of another.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229603247&amp;sr=8-1">Lakoff and Johnson</a> (1980)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, seeing (or, &#8220;experiencing&#8221;, since &#8220;seeing&#8221; is really a metaphor) one idea or concept in terms of another is a kind of abstraction. You&#8217;re essentially changing your perspective on something by bringing in another concept. Metaphor, generally, is about comparison and noting the similarity, but I suppose there can be an element of the dissimilarity which makes them work. So, if I use a literary metaphor (comparing two things without the use of a similating word like &#8220;like&#8221; or &#8220;as&#8221;) and say: &#8220;this computer is rubbish&#8221;; I&#8217;m fundamentally making a comparison between the two notionsâ€”&#8221;this computer&#8221; and &#8220;rubbish&#8221;. It is the similarity which I am stressing; and, on the surface, using &#8220;rubbish&#8221; as a sort of modifier of the computer.</p>
<p>However, there is a whole plethora of meaning in this statement, if you pull yourself back from it a bit. What&#8217;s rubbish? Rubbish is stuff we throw away; it can smell bad; it&#8217;s collected from our houses and fills holes in the ground; we don&#8217;t want rubbish; we don&#8217;t like rubbish;  it&#8217;s a generic term for things we don&#8217;t like or are unhappy with. With this simple statement, I&#8217;m ever-so-casually bashing together large quantities of information and notion, and letting the meanings fall where they will. Inside this somewhere is the idea of &#8220;propositionality&#8221;, meaning that I&#8217;m letting the hearer of this statement draw their own conclusions to what I&#8217;m saying (he&#8217;s not happy with his computer, his computer may not be very good, he wouldn&#8217;t recommend it, he&#8217;s having a bad day&#8230;) some of which is intended, some of it not (at, least, not consciously). There are also cultural considerations in that there is a sort of social consensus that this metaphor &#8220;works&#8221; and that we must not literally interpret this statement as an intention to physically dispose of an object (which is good when you consider any time you&#8217;ve ever heard a person &#8220;understood or experienced in terms of&#8221; rubbish <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> This leads me to think that there are also elements of disassociation between the two concepts, so that some of the meaning is actually in the difference between &#8220;rubbish&#8221; and &#8220;this computer&#8221;. I&#8217;m probably not going to throw it away (at least, not immediately); It&#8217;s probably something I&#8217;ve bought and have no intention of burying in the ground; I expect to be happy or satisfied with it (whereas, you wouldn&#8217;t about a used tea-bag). So, the two concepts modify each other, they&#8217;re like points in a perspective, making it possible to glean added meaning from the situation which is greater than just the two ideas themselves.</p>
<p>(if you&#8217;re still reading by here, <a href="mailto:zach@zachbeauvais.com">email me</a>, and we&#8217;ll have a pint!)</p>
<p>I mentioned in my previous post that data are used in abstraction. What I mean by this, is that a bit of data is &#8220;used&#8221; in a process when it&#8217;s a point of reference for something. This number + that number = another number, the two numbers are reference points for the sum. When I say: &#8220;I&#8217;m busy on the 2nd&#8221; it means that I&#8217;ve referred to a bit of data (a number on a calendar application, an email, or whatever) that I&#8217;ve used as a point of comparison. I&#8217;ve essentially understood the projected state of my schedule in terms of what i&#8217;ve already planned to occur. And, these bits of data are more and more powerful when the perspective you gain from them is more accurate.</p>
<p>When we get more reference points, and more interactions, our perspective becomes more flexible. We can abstract ourselves right out, and look at a very broad picture. Google&#8217;s Pagerank does this by mining clickstream information from a very, very large dataset using very simple reference points: the number of links to an item increases its position in the rank. Conversely, we can focus right in on a single notion or dataset using as many different references as possible to understand a limited set of transactions. Amazon&#8217;s book results page is full of this kind of perspective with user-ratings, purchase histories, browsing behaviour, and mathematical algorithms to give a very full picture (and options to accomplish a task) of a single notion.</p>
<p>So, I think that data are very similar to metaphor in that they are used to understand one thing (or set of things) in terms of another (or others).</p>
<p>The upshot of this is that we can refer to this <a class="zem_slink" title="Concept" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/Concept">abstract concept</a> of &#8220;data&#8221; in terms that help us to understand both their significance and their utility to us. When I say: &#8220;I want my data to do this&#8221;, it&#8217;s not that helpful unless you understand that I&#8217;m trying to get all my reference points to produce a perspective to help me accomplish something. Which leads me to my main point: the whole point of metaphor is to helpâ€”or possibly enableâ€”our understanding. Data should do the same. Collecting all the bits and pieces of information you incur by being a person and doing things should bring you some form of understanding leading to a benefit.</p>
