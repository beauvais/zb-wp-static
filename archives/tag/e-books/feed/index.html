								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/3470579652"><img class="alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/3470579652_ff14965e31_m.jpg?resize=240%2C180" alt="Wooden Kindle" width="240" height="180" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Ebooks are doing rather well, with Amazon announcing them outselling their <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/07/amazon-e-books-outsell-hardcovers/">print counterparts</a> in bestsellers lists. I&#8217;ve enjoyed using the Kindle app for various reasons including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant purchase/download (even Amazon Prime can take too long!)</li>
<li>One device, not many books</li>
<li>Reading in the dark (on the iPad, any way)</li>
<li>Searching and smart(ish) bookmarking</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I&#8217;d love to see various improvements, and a novel things I&#8217;m not sure I have a fully-formed idea around yet (I&#8217;d like new things with the power of computing devices, but I&#8217;m not sure yet what they might be.)</p>
<p>But something has interested me a lot with a piece I read in <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/5_ways_that_ebooks_are_better_than_paper_books.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>. The piece talks about various ways in which ebooks are better than paper ones, and it mentions &#8220;social highlighting&#8221;, that is: the ability to share electronically highlighted text and notes. Richard MacManus goes on to suggest better features and improvements, and I&#8217;m fully in agreement here: the social aspect of ebooks has yet to be developed much at all, it seems.</p>
<p>Now, these social tools could follow a very predictable path, taking in the evolution of social tools elsewhere: multi-site sharing options, tweets, facebook connecting (I &#8220;like&#8221; the Kite Runner) etc. No doubt they will. But the thing that really grabbed me was the <a href="http://kindle.amazon.com/popular_highlights">little gem of a site</a> showing the most highlighted passages in the Kindle bookstore. This means that Amazon knows what&#8217;s being highlighted. It means—I&#8217;m just guessing here—that publishers could begin to know how much books are actually read. You know that copy of A Brief History of Time you bought?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a very straightforward metric, but one that&#8217;s immediately useful to amazon, publishers, and authors. What else could be gleaned from vey simple and anonymous data like these?</p>
<p>What other data are Amazon using, and what else could be done with finer-grained data from users? Imagine language studies over tricky phrases in intralingual dictionaries! Finally, how can this be turned directly over to consumers?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to know my own reading patterns, which words and phrases I highlight.</p>
