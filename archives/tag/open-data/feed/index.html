								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/4026358878"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 10px" src="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/4026358878_5f277de7a9_m.jpg?w=1090" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Last week, I met up with some folks who are building some amazing things with public data. After seeing their <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/data-gov-uk-newspaper">Postcode Paper</a> project, I was left with the lasting impression that given the raw materials, there is very little hindrance to what can be built.</p>
<p>In the Postcode Paper, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/tomtaylor.co.uk">Tom Taylor</a>, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/www.gavinbell.com">Gavin Bell</a>, and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/fluffykittens.com">Dan Catt</a> brought together data from a whole bunch of online sources into a single resource which can be easily distributed to residents of a local neighbourhood. Also, because this proof-of-concept is a real newspaper (i.e. made from paper and everything), it bridges any digital divide and gives access to people who might not otherwise find such information online.</p>
<p>To me, the real brilliance behind the paper is the context it provides for your location. Through its simple newspaper metaphor of headings and sections, one can very quickly find something exactly, or absorb trivia by browsing the headings. So, for example, there is a section for &#8220;Healthcare&#8221; which provides a list of dentists, GPs, A&amp;E services and the name of the Primary Care Trusts serving your area. Combining this kind of immediately useful information with some general facts about an area (crime rates and trends, green-space, recycling centres and even allotment information) gives a profoundly well-informed picture of a given neighbourhood.</p>
<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/4026355692"><img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 10px" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/4026355692_80605aaafa_m.jpg?w=1090" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In a stroke of genius, the lads have added travel times from that postcode to a series of important destinations along with travel times. So, from E5 0JA to Oxford Circus takes 4 minutes via bicycle and 42 on public transport; and it&#8217;s 3 hours to Paris or Bristol on the train.There&#8217;s even a route-map for local busses and Underground transport.</p>
<p>Part of the thinking behind it is that local authorities could print these every few months or so to send to newcomers. Imagine finding such a rich resource in your post after paying council tax for the first time! I&#8217;ve lived in my current town for 2 years now, and I don&#8217;t know about half the information this contains. It&#8217;s presented extremely clearly and in a very familiar format, so there is very little problem communicating across generational, cultural or potentially even linguistic divides. (Much of the information, such as journey times, doctors surgeries and crime rates would need little translation.) It also doesn&#8217;t take much imagination to see additional features or benefits spinning off of this kind of service.</p>
<p>Put the paper online, with live-updates of the information and widgets for transport. Add in some basic demographics (gender, age bracket, long-time resident or visitor), and you&#8217;ve got hugely-flexible possibilities for providing an extremely clear UI to your community&#8217;s site. Tailoring some specifics, such as age, might let you see more information about local schools, for example, then about old-age care. With print-on-demand kiosks in local libraries and post-offices, you could have an up-to-date snapshot of your neighbourhood whenever you need. This could be used by school children for local projects (and if they can tailor the paper themselves, how much more exciting!). It could be an aid to public transparency with clearly-presented statistics like crime and school standards rates. The list of ideas is endless, really.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the vision, any way. In reality, there are still some huge hurdles to cross before this kind of service could even begin to become a reality. This project took only a few days to put together, but the supremely brainy folk behind it have years of data management skills behind them. They focused on a single postcode, and many of the data needed had to be hand-scraped from various sites and files. The work needed to launch an on-demand service would be daunting indeed, because no local authority would provide a unified point of access for this kind of information. Currently, if a council wanted to provide this kind of resource, researchers would have to go out and find the facts and figures from across the web (NHS sites, central and local government sites, education and reporting services, etc), compile them and produce an individual layout for each individual postcode. And, if you&#8217;re an organisation interested in this, you would potentially be required to pay £1000s to access the basic building-blocks: post code lookups and survey boundary data. Needless to say, local authorities and businesses would be hard-pressed to find the time to build such papers to such a fine level of localisation.</p>
<p>Any startup, application, or service wanting to offer localised information is up against some severe inclines. It takes little imagination to see this paper and similar applications taking off and providing huge benefit to where people spend most of their time—at home. However, I fear much of these innovations will remain in imaginations as long as so much of the material needed to build them remains locked away.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mag3737/224970554/"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 5px" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm1.static.flickr.com/86/224970554_2bed377771_m.jpg?w=1090" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>So, we&#8217;ve been banging on about opening up access to public data for a while. Talis has put its money where its mouth is and <a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/about/">helped to fund</a> the PDDL to give organisations a legal framework for dedicating their data to the public domain. (We&#8217;ll even host open data for free on the Platform under the Connected Commons.) We see the benefits of open data being shared innovation, and many projects exist which make use of this data for <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/greenxchange/">scientific</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog">journalistic</a>, <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">entertaining</a> and just plain <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">useful</a> purposes. We&#8217;ve been seeing a strong trend towards removing siloes and encouraging reuse of information resources to the point that we&#8217;ve begun to create our own jargon around open access. This is great, and even governments are beginning to see the benefit of this with projects like data.gov and Sir Tim Berners-Lee&#8217;s advisory appointment in the UK.</p>
<p>But there is an alternate side to this story of opening up and sharing our data. Where there is open, there is an implied &#8220;closed&#8221; too. Some closed data is absolutely necessary—you wouldn&#8217;t argue that your recent financial transactions are data I should have a right to pry into, for obvious example. There is a lot of hidden data necessary to run applications and to make a profit, and it is entirely right that this should be the case.</p>
<p>But a recent case here in the UK has illustrated the point that if open data encourages innovation, closing down data can quash it. The Royal Mail recently sent cease and desist letters to the directors of ernestmarples.com, who had been providing online services with a set of API&#8217;s to turn UK postcodes into location information. This provision had enabled the building of services which, for example, <a href="http://jobcentreproplus.com/">let people look for jobs in their area</a>, and <a href="http://www.thestraightchoice.org/">monitor and map political leaflet claims</a>. The Royal Mail charges £4000 to make use of its official list of Postcodes, and wasn&#8217;t happy with ernestmarples.org providing postcode data for free. (ernestmarples.com did not license the data, but scraped it from other sites, apparently.) As soon as ernestmarples.com stopped providing the lookup, all the services built on the data were stopped too. So, in effect, the data was enclosed again behind a barrier of a steep paywall and legal action.</p>
<p>There is a lot of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/07/newly-asked-question-royal-mail-postzon">discussion</a> about whether the UK postcode data should be free anyway. It was funded by public funds, for one thing, and it only generates around £11million annually for Royal Mail. The subscription rate is high for startups or non-profits, especially when compared with the Zip-code data in the United States, which I found out only costs $500/year to purchase. {1} It could also be argued that the steep pricing is an archaic throw-back to a time where such services cost a lot to provide, so needed to be high in order to recover costs. But this reverse peppercorn rent could no longer be valid, and £4000 must certainly be an order of magnitude (or two) higher than the cost of provision.</p>
<p>There is a lot to discuss about specific datasets like this, and they may need to be tried legally and publicly before all the details are sorted out, but this case is about as illustrative as possible of the principle of encouraging innovation. A single, simple and non-charging service provided a framework for thousands of users for mostly socially-beneficial aims. Imagine the impact if hundreds of source-services had access to postcode data? Perhaps tens of thousands of users could look for employment, or track their local governmental organisations&#8217; progress. Who knows what else might have been developed? It doesn&#8217;t take a huge leap of imagination to envision services tailored to your very local locality, does it? Just as easily, though, the enclosure of a single database has cut off a huge network of potential innovation.</p>
<p>The Guardian has covered the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/05/ernest-marples-royal-mail-postcodes-legal-threat">story</a>, if you want more details too.</p>

<p>{1} I&#8217;m not entirely sure about the licensing of the Zip-code data, but the representative I spoke with at USPS said you can purchase the 5-digit Zipcode product for $500/a.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>|This article first appeared in Nodalities Magazine, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2">CC By + SA</a></strong></p>
<p>For anyone following the Nodalities blog, you may have read some of my recent posts discussing the trends boiling up around Web 3.0 (other buzzwords are available). The Mobile Web and upgraded connectivity in general; the rise of ubiquitous computing from chips in every product imaginable; Linked Data and the “Semantic Web” as an organising platform for this rising tide of data—these are three very broad trends seeing a lot of media attention presently. From where I’m standing, I tend to see the next great turning point of the Web as a convergence of some of these trends, and see it as a rise in the importance of and reliance upon data itself and data tools generally.</p>
<p>The mobile web is bringing new sorts of information to people, and they can make use of this info wherever they happen to be because of advances in devices ad connectivity. As phones and web-enabled devices get better, so to do the chips we seem to have embedded all over the place, and we can now begin to have a more clear picture of what we do through the information we gather from our heaters, cars, and pedometers. Also, as more objects become connected, the grunt-work of number-crunching and storage is becoming commoditised into big, efficient, utility-like cloud services, which host and work with our collected information much more effectively than the gadget in your hand could ever hope to do. Others, like us here at Talis, talk about the Semantic Web, which allows for an evolution from a bunch of connected documents to the explicit connections between bits of information.</p>
<p>Also fermenting in this mix is a strengthening trend of political transparency and a public, shared ownership of social data. Barack Obama’s new administration has clearly made this a priority with the launch and work around data.gov; and in the UK, Sir Tim Berners-Lee himself has been appointed to an Parliamentary advisory role. There is growing pressure to be able to have access to public data, and to see it as belonging to the nation’s people rather than allowed to be legitimately filed away in the great, locked bureau of the capitols.</p>
<p>So, picking up two fairly obvious trends here: Social, Public Data and Linked Data; it would seem to follow that people would begin to have access to previously unavailable information in usable, linked forms. And it’s certainly beginning, as articles elsewhere in this magazine have illustrated. But, what about other chunks of public data? What about when data comes from universities, institutions, scientific foundations and NGO’s? What about charities monitoring crime, CO2 emissions and family histories? Wouldn’t these make a useful piece in the web of social data? What resources have the governments themselves got, if they want to make their public-owned data available in a useful format?</p>
<p>These questions form a major part of the thinking behind Talis’ Connected Commons initiative (talis.com/cc). Basically, Talis has made its Semantic Web platform (including data hosting and access tools) available free of charge for any datasets made available to the public. In doing so, we’re hoping to remove the barrier of cost entirely to publishing interesting data in a Linked Data way. One major reason for this is to promote reuse and mashups of this interesting data, and for people to be able to “follow their noses” to the data that completes their projects. But, from a publishers’ perspective, this is important, because it’s removing a major reason not to bother with making data useful, if not only public. So, with this, data can be made public and useable and the developers and users get the benefit of public SPARQL endpoints and API access to interesting data.</p>
<p>To keep the data open and public, datasets need to make use of either the Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) or Creative Commons’ CC0 license. Ian Davis, in his article in this magazine, explains more about waivers and the Connected Commons, and there is a lot more about this particular initiative over on the Talis site (talis.com/platform/cc/faqs/).</p>
<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Sir Tim said: “This is our data. This is our taxpayers’ money which has created this data, so I would like to be able to see it, please.” I wonder if initiatives such as Connected Commons will begin to remove excuses, hindrances, and obstacles? As public awareness of the importance of access gets hotter, this might become a political issue, as well as a pragmatic one. I hope that in the rush to publish data, and in the ensuing discussion and debate that follows, that the users, hackers and developers don’t get sidelined. I think the world is ready for its data back.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>|This first appeared as a <a href="http://readwrite.com/2009/08/04/journalism_needs_data_in_21st_century/">guest post on ReadWriteWeb</a>, republished with kind permission</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beauvais/3791106495/sizes/o/"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 10px;" title="Not News" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2515/3791106495_d9c4cd9d08_m.jpg?resize=193%2C240" alt="" width="193" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Journalism has always been about reporting facts and assertions and making sense of world affairs. No news there. But as we move further into the 21st century, we will have to increasingly rely on &#8220;data&#8221; to feed our stories, to the point that &#8220;data-driven reporting&#8221; becomes second nature to journalists.</p>
<p>The shift from facts to data is subtle and makes perfect sense. You could that say data <em>are</em> facts, with the difference that they can be computed, analysed, and made use of in a more abstract way, especially by a computer.</p>
<p>With this mindset, finding mainstream data-driven stories doesn&#8217;t take long at all. A quick scan of the Guardian&#8217;s home page tells us that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jul/16/swine-flu-cases-rise-britain">swine flu cases are up by 50%</a>, according to &#8220;fresh figures&#8230;[that] will be released this afternoon.&#8221; The story here is that we&#8217;re in danger because swine flu is on the rise. Reporting the current figures available for swine flu alone wouldn&#8217;t be all that interesting. The news comes from comparing the current figures to last week&#8217;s, which is a very simple form of data analysis. By making use of published data and running one&#8217;s own analysis (and building on the analysis of others), we get something very news-worthy indeed. It moves the definition ever so slightly, from &#8220;saying and asserting&#8221; to &#8220;analyzing and publishing.&#8221; But it obviously works only for data that is accessible.</p>
<p>There is nothing new about pointing out the importance of public data being made available. <a class="zem_slink" title="Tim Berners-Lee" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> has discussed at length the importance of governments and institutions putting their data online, making it accessible and useful. His <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/484">TED talk</a> and interviews with <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/interview_with_tim_berners-lee_part_1.php">ReadWriteWeb</a> and Talis (disclosure: I am a blogger at Talis) all explain his belief that by publishing <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/linked_data_is_blooming_why_you_should_care.php">linked data</a> we can begin to solve many of the problems the world faces. Innovations in medicine, science, and development could all be achieved if only currently hidden data were made available. Data-driven journalism could be the first step in realizing this dream. The best stories would then come from innovators who read about trends reported in news media and are then able to draw new conclusions and solve bigger problems. In his recent discussion with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/06/sir_tims_cry_raw_data_now.html">BBC</a>, Berners-Lee said that the next step is to go for low-hanging fruit by just getting the data out there.</p>
<p>Thus far, this has made a lot of sense to me, and I have been tracking the publication of linked data and increasing access to public knowledge as emerging trends over at Talis. But my perspective has shifted a bit in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>First, there was <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a> and President Obama&#8217;s call for more access to government data. A sitting head of state (and one of some significance) was clearly calling for public access to government data: this was news! But the idea has been discussed, praised, and debated for a while since then and may have <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/datagov_finally_launches_looks_nice_but_short_on_d.php">lost some of its luster</a>.</p>
<p>Then about a month ago, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown made it part of his digital strategy to prioritize the publication of government information. He asked Sir Tim personally &#8220;to help us drive the opening up of access to Government data in the web over the coming months&#8221; and appointed Berners-Lee an official governmental adviser. By now, neither of these stories is news and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/open_goverment_berners-lee_and_the_uk_to_show_obam.php">comparisons between the initiatives</a> have been made.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="The Guardian" rel="homepage" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian</a> newspaper recently launched its own <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/mar/10/blogpost1">Data Blog</a>, with the intention of letting readers access, mash up, and reuse much of its information in the form of data, which could in turn drive stories.</p>
<p>What is perhaps not as explicitly recognized is the voracious appetite for data that has been apparent for months. It is less about turning good ideas into stories and more about seeing how data informs our understanding of events happening right now. Each new initiative is another piece of low-hanging fruit picked.</p>
<p>Access to data is important: it drives innovation and even social change. Governments that publish their data <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/what_can_you_do_with_government_data.php">have to become more transparent</a>. Humanitarian organizations that make their findings known could spark bigger projects and source innovative solutions from their communities. Scientific findings and raw information could be used to solve bigger problems than the result of a single experiment or trial could ever manage. Even the simple comparison of two or more facts can lead to new insight, and all of these things happen only when the walls around an institution become porous.</p>
<p>2009 could become known as the year of data, the year of open access, or the year of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Semantic Web" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic Web</a> (see links above for how this relates), and it may also be the first year when it becomes news that data wasn&#8217;t published in a story when it should have been. That a government body isn&#8217;t being transparent or is blocking access by publishing its findings in PDF or other non-linking formats would make a very interesting story indeed. We can expect to see more and more organizations and public bodies remove their own barriers through initiatives and legislation. Examples have been set, and seeing excuses die along with barriers is not far-fetched.</p>
<p>Do you know of other data-driven stories? We&#8217;d love to hear about any insights that were made through publicly accessible data or where this data might come from next.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Originally appeared on Nodalities Blog: http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities</strong></p>
<p><a class="alignleft" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/l"><img style="margin-right: 5px" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/3029256542_0d6b8871e7_m.jpg?w=1090" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It&#8217;s hardly new for this blog or our community to cover issues of open access and making information useful for users. But, what if we were to begin speaking in terms  such as: &#8220;A call for transparency,&#8221; or subtly replace <em>user</em> with <em>citizen</em>?  With little substantive shift of core meaning, the whole message becomes one of rights, responsibilities, and public duty.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been watching this week as the ember at the heart of this dialogue has been fanned with air-time on mainstream media, and is about to receive its fuel. First, UK Prime Minister Gorden Brown asked Sir Tim Berners-Lee  &#8220;to help us drive the opening up of access to Government data in the web over the coming months&#8221; appointing him to a special role advising Parliament. In an <a title="interview audio" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/8096793.stm">interview</a> with BBC tech correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, Sir Tim discussed his position; explaining that he&#8217;s pushing for transparency: &#8220;This is our data. This is our taxpayers&#8217; money which has created this data, so I would like to be able to see it, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Tim had the audience at the <a title="TED Talk, Sir Tim Berners-Lee" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html">tech-friendly TED</a> conference chanting &#8220;Raw Data Now&#8221; back in February, and he&#8217;s now been invited by a sitting government leader to make this happen.</p>
<p>This week also saw the publication of the <a title="Digital Britain PDF—made available via bbc.co.uk" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/16_06_09digitalbritain.pdf">Digital Britain</a> report, outlining Parliament&#8217;s plans for a more connected future. I must admit, for the record, that I haven&#8217;t read all 239 pages of the report (made available via bbc.co.uk), rather, I&#8217;ve skimmed it and read several overviews. The gist seems to be that the UK plans to invest in the future of its citizens&#8217; internet connectivity, upgrading existing infrastructure and providing access where there currently isn&#8217;t. This investment will cover both wired broadband provision (with a stated aim of 2MBps minimum for every household) and wireless, encouraging investment in 3g provision by allowing mobile companies to have their network licenses more permanently.  It recommends subsidising development wherever the market can&#8217;t provide; seemingly equating net access with public utilities (The PM further <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/article6506136.ece">clarified his thought</a>s by saying the Internet is as vital as water or gas). More information on this report can be found on the summary page at the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/digital-britain">Guardian</a>, on twitter: hashtag #digitalbritain, and Bill Thompson&#8217;s tech-centric <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/digital-britain-engaging-with-the-internet">overview</a>.</p>
<p>All this week needs is a major announcement of something moving entirely to cloud-computing to look a bit like the convergence I blogged about a few days ago ;).</p>
<p>So, what has this incredible week brought us? It&#8217;s a governmental lead on opening up access to data. Their appointment of TBL makes me think that it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;ll see more and more linked-data projects coming from the public sector (not just access to, but usable, linked data). Over the next few years, the UK plans to improve its infrastructure and incentivize development on communications networks, and they&#8217;ve begun to use language suggesting that being part of the network and access to Public data are rights issues.</p>
<p>Sir Tim spoke, in the interview, about beginning with low-hanging fruit: pilot schemes which open up data and watch what happens.</p>
<p>What are you building?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/2382314257_9993d2c07d_m.jpg"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 5px;" src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/2382314257_9993d2c07d_m.jpg?resize=240%2C222" alt="three" width="240" height="222" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/www.talis.com">Talis</a>, my employer, has been a big promoter of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/linkeddata.org"> Linked Data</a> and open-access to information, because we see that new ideas often arise when existing ideas come together. Innovation, if you like, occurs at the join between ideas when they connect. I see this as fundamental to the way ideas and their applications (technology) advance. I tend to believe that anything &#8220;novel&#8221; is actually affected when other ideas are connected together.</p>
<p>In the technological world, this seems like a strong analogy for Linked Data: information which can be connected by a web-like network of links. These Linked Data have become the foundation for what has come to be known as the “Semantic Web”, a web of connected information which breaks out of information silos and enables the discovery of new ideas from old, and innovation from existing information. We use the phrase &#8220;serendipitous reuse&#8221; for the idea that once an idea (or a piece of data) is published, it can be used and reused in novel ways and in context of other data to produce unexpected, and unforeseeable possibilities. These ideas (data, again) become increasingly useful when published in a format which allows them to be linked freely to ANY other piece of information. We&#8217;ve had the distribution method for this network for years (the good, ol WWW itself) and it&#8217;s been about a year since  RDF was launched by the WWW Consortium to handle the data itself. The idea is basically to give every bit of data an address (a universal address, not one subjective to a database like a cell reference), and to predicate that bit of information very much like language does. If you think of it like a language, RDF lets bits of data (nouns) to be acted upon or act upon (verbs) others (other nouns). This triple-format enables a near infinite recombination (theoretically) of any data, anywhere with an address.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the problem? Well, most of the world&#8217;s data are locked away in silos (prisoners of the cells their databases confine them to). Many organisations may wish to make use of their data in a semantic environment, and many might even embrace the Open-source nature of their data, and make it freely available to the world to recombine and use: there are always more innovations outside an organisation than within! In order to lower barriers to enter this linked data world, Talis has built a Platform with resources to host and utilise these connections, making use of semantic web standards (RDF and SPARQL, the query language of the semantic web) and a developer-friendly environment (a RESTFul API, for example).</p>
<p>However, this innovation is only possible when data are accessible. In order to further lower the barriers, Talis is now offering free access to the Platform to host public domain data. We are calling this initiative the Talis Connected Commons, and the offer is not limited to free hosting: the data access services, including access to a public SPARQL endpoint, are also freely available. To keep this data open, you will need to use either the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/1">Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License</a> or the recently launched <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/zero">Creative Commons CC0 license</a> to publish data. Anyone will then be able to freely access the stored data using the Platform services, without API keys and without usage limits.</p>
<p>There is more information available at www.talis.com/cc, where you can find detailed technical information, FAQ’s and other resources.</p>
