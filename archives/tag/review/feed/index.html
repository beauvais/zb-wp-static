Gadgets, people, blogs, books, tips, wine—all good things. At least, the web is full of interesting <em>pages</em> about these things. In a single session, you might read a mate&#8217;s blog (maybe about wine), then browse a retail site for a book that that mate recommended and stumble across a brilliant gadget. That&#8217;s five good things in the space of a few minutes. Here they are, in case you missed them: your mate&#8217;s a person (good), and he&#8217;s got a blog (debatable, but there you go). He&#8217;s talking about wine (which is definitely good), and he happens to recommend a book (great). In the process, you stumble across a gadget (brilliant!).</p>
<p>The problem with all that is that you didn&#8217;t instantly recognise all the good things in that very brief narrative sentence. The web is an interconnected bunch of arbitrarily-related pages, like a catalogue of (often good) stuff, without an index. It&#8217;s arbitrary, because the pages only exist when it&#8217;s linked to; and the <em>stuff</em> can be anything from a purchasable item to an innovative idea. This network is mind-numbingly huge and even the most versatile of polymaths can&#8217;t be interested in all of it. So, what we want is all the good stuff, and we want it with all the flexibility an arbitrary system can offer (I like <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/17332-Stormhoek_Pinotage" target="_blank">this</a>, <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ref=br_lf_m_1000229463_1_4_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;s=electronics&amp;pf_rd_p=223234991&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_i=1000229463&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_r=1K4Z2YBQWEFRY8RBEVEH" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Sigur+R%C3%B3s" target="_blank">this</a>&#8230; are they related in any way?)</p>
<p>Well, when <em>I</em> look at them, I can see that they&#8217;re related; and not just because I happen to have chosen three things I like. I have had the tremendous privilege of testing a gadget which lets me capture these things, and lets me peek at how they connect with my own little perspective on the web. The gadget&#8217;s called <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/getglue.com">Glue</a>, and it&#8217;s the latest offering from <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/www.adaptiveblue.com">AdaptiveBlue</a>. I&#8217;ve blogged about AdaptiveBlue&#8217;s Smartlinks in the past, and they&#8217;re responsible for the little icons next to the linked things above (if you have a decent browser). What they&#8217;ve been doing is allowing you to contextualise the stuff on the web, and Glue goes a step further by letting you also interact with other folks&#8217; contexts.</p>
<p><a class="lightview" href="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/glue_xw4i5u.png"><img data-attachment-id="189" data-permalink="https://beggingaquestion.com/archives/glue-sticks-stuff-together/glue/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/glue_xw4i5u.png?fit=61%2C21&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="61,21" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="glue" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/glue_xw4i5u.png?fit=61%2C21&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/glue_xw4i5u.png?fit=61%2C21&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-189" style="margin: 5px;" title="glue" src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/glue_xw4i5u.png?resize=61%2C21" alt="" width="61" height="21" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Firstly, Glue is a browser plugin for <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/firefox">Firefox</a> (remember, I said to get a decent browser?). Glue creates a  bookmark in your bar, but the real magic occurs when you navigate to some <em>stuff</em>. As you seek out or stumble across interesting things online, the Glue menu glides down, giving you instant options to &#8220;like&#8221; the item, find out more about it, and see who else has &#8220;liked&#8221; it too. They have an excellent walk-through on their site, so I won&#8217;t duplicate their efforts by explaining how it works here, but it does recognise many kinds of &#8220;stuff&#8221; from a myriad of very important sites. <img data-attachment-id="193" data-permalink="https://beggingaquestion.com/archives/glue-sticks-stuff-together/sigur-ros/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sigur-ros_eyml00.png?fit=450%2C492&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="450,492" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="sigur-ros" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sigur-ros_eyml00.png?fit=274%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sigur-ros_eyml00.png?fit=450%2C492&amp;ssl=1" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-193" style="margin: 5px;" title="sigur-ros" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sigur-ros_eyml00-274x300.png?resize=274%2C300" alt="" width="274" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sigur-ros_eyml00.png?resize=274%2C300&amp;ssl=1 274w, https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sigur-ros_eyml00.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1 450w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The interesting part, for me, is that it brings a context to all the arbitrary links we follow all the time. We can see where we fit in with this, and what our mates think too. Best of all, these things are treated just like that: as the things in which we&#8217;re interested. I want to talk about <em>this</em> book, not this page about the book. I want to rate this book, and if a friend sees it on another site, he&#8217;ll still see that I liked it!</p>
<p>Best of all, it&#8217;s a social network without the need for a social-networking space. It&#8217;s the first thing I&#8217;ve seen which successfully breaks out of the need to be inside a specific place in order to interact and contextualise—we don&#8217;t need MyFace&#8217;s training wheels! Glue shifts its focus from trying to hem in, or reduce the web, to elegantly augmenting it.</p>
<p>As you can tell, I really like this gadget, and I thank @fraser and @alexiskold for building it, and letting me have a play of the Beta.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Image:Fulton.jpg"></a></p>
<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged">
<div style="width: 153px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Image:Fulton.jpg"><img title="February 11: Fulton patents steamboat." src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/202px-Fulton.jpg?resize=143%2C204" alt="February 11: Fulton patents steamboat." width="143" height="204" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>
</div>
<p>I have begun to see that we may be entering a new age of polymaths, and I&#8217;m happy to be involved in a part of the business world which seems to sustain some of the best brains on the planet.</p>
<p>I remember reading about the beginners of industry—the pioneers of technology and science. I remember reading how <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Robert_Fulton">Robert Fulton</a> came up against problems in life, and simply invented new ways of doing things, leading eventually to the development of steam-powered paddle-wheel-boats. I remember, vaguely, from my propagandistically pro-industrial schooling that as a child, Fulton had invented or improved on the lead pencil, because the one he was using in school wasn&#8217;t up to scratch. The same story is reflected through many of the West&#8217;s inventors of what we&#8217;ve retrospectively come to call <a class="zem_slink" title="Industrial Revolution" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Industrial_Revolution">the Industrial Revolution</a>: when opportunity or difficulty forced their hands, they changed the situation.</p>
<p>Now, aside from natural romanticism, I like to look to the past with neither rose-tinted glasses nor &#8220;isn&#8217;t-everything-better-now&#8221; short-sightedness. I&#8217;m sure that for every changer, there were crowds of followers in every age, and I&#8217;m sure many of you could point easily to both an earth-changer and a follower without too much effort. Besides, history pays scant attention to followers.</p>
<p>No, what I&#8217;m talking about is the seeming ease with which many of my colleagues in the web industry switch between impressively diverse tasks. Some I know make impressive presenters, and happen to hold PhD&#8217;s in fields more or less unrelated to what they do now&#8230; and can code Java and know a bit of <a class="zem_slink" title="Cascading Style Sheets" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> on the side. I fear to challenge any to play chess (since I haven&#8217;t played in over 5 years, and have the patience of a twelve-year-old), and several are rumoured to be better-than-average musicians. This diversified excellence, alongside the startups, ideas, enthusiastic organisations and programmes i&#8217;ve seen recently, remind me of the society-changers of a century and more ago. Not since then, I think, has such an importance been placed on ambition within social responsibilities.</p>
<div class="alignright"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NgSRwOZtDQ8&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/NgSRwOZtDQ8&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
<p>One of the things I&#8217;ve seen most recently has been the Google 10^100 (apparently pronounced: ten to the one-hundredth with a typically geeky need to explain the pun) which aims to &#8220;help as many people as we can&#8221; by contributing $10million to fund earth-changing ideas. Their site is, in classic Google fashion, very straightforward, so I won&#8217;t repeat their blurb&#8230;just go have a read. But, while you are doing it, I dare you to set aside any cynicism you may harbour either toward a big business, or to any notion of &#8220;changing the world&#8221;. Think about what has and is being done, and then think how you could change the world.</p>

If you don&#8217;t follow, that&#8217;s OK. The point is that my old site was Drupal (a heavy-duty Content Management System, which is fantastic) now it&#8217;s Wordperss (cause it does blogging, and does it well). Well, WordPress has won my geeky heart (it&#8217;s smaller than my cynical heart, and not as strong as my music heart, but probably the most covered here).</p>
<p>They have done one thing in the past month which has really, really impressed me. They&#8217;ve got a plugin which lets you upgrade to the latest version of their software (which you install on your webserver yourself) without any complicated, difficult-to-remember steps. This is why I lost Drupal: upgrading, and it killing itself in the transfer. Now, I have the latest WordPress, and I&#8217;m very impressed.</p>
<p>Its WYSIWYG editor works better, and the media manager is fantastic. As you probably know, I stopped using a local blogging client because ecto is rubbish, and Vista is worse. So I now blog from WordPress itself through Firefox on my Mac. Three things that make me happy: WordPress on Firefox running on a Mac&#8230; ah!</p>
<p>Another thing which is brilliant is the flickr sidebar plugin I have had for ages. I completely forgot to check out its &#8220;<a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/flickr">view more photos</a>&#8221; link. It automatically finds images from the sets I&#8217;ve told it about, and uses them to create a page on my site populated with my flickr stream images!</p>
<p>On a down side, I&#8217;ve just noticed that it&#8217;s impossible to see the bottom of the sidebar if Twitter is down, because I have my tweets (micro-blog messages) being pulled into a widget above it, so if it&#8217;s down, it doesn&#8217;t load the rest of the sidebar. I think that&#8217;s something WordPress should sort out. Oh, well. I&#8217;m just going to switch my images tab over to flickr.</p>

Image by <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2319114487" target="_blank">. SantiMB . (too busy)</a> via Flickr</div>
<p>I grew up in a Mac family. My dad used to programme <em>accounts recievable</em> applications on an old, black and white Macintosh, and that was my first encounter with any sort of GUI. Since then, I&#8217;ve used both Mac&#8217;s and PC&#8217;s and have a <a class="zem_slink" title="MacBook" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/MacBook">MacBook</a> for work and a poorly-running, but still brand-new Vista box in my home study. I&#8217;ve even dabbled with Linux several times.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m starting to realise something: an aweful lot of applications (on every platform) get aesthetics completely wrong.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a balance between looking nice, feeling comfortable, and aiding use. I think that the appearance of an application is as important a part of the design as the application itself. It&#8217;s a <em>part </em>of the usability, it&#8217;s not &#8216;eye candy&#8217; slapped on for gratuitous reasons.</p>
<p>This is something Mac&#8217;s understand, and their GUI is gorgeous. Vista&#8217;s pretty good-looking itself, but that&#8217;s it&#8217;s problem: that&#8217;s all it is. The operating system is huge, heavy, slow and unpredictible. It crashes, hangs, and takes minutes to load. I bought a brand new (though admittedly budget-conscious PC) from a manufacturer who shall remain nameless (cough! Dell! cough&#8230;) which barely runs just the <a class="zem_slink" title="Operating system" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Operating_system">OS</a>. I&#8217;ve had to triple the RAM and will be re-installing this weekend.</p>
<p>So, what Can I do about it? I can switch <a class="zem_slink" title="Windows Aero" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Windows_Aero">Aero</a> off&#8230; leaving me with a huge, heavy, unpredictable and slightly-less-slow OS which is now ugly. So there&#8217;s Vista, tipping in the balance with an &#8220;eye candy&#8221; approach at aesthetic design.</p>
<p>I see the visual layout, graphics, and overall presence of an application as part of it&#8217;s feature-set. It should be intuitive to interact with it somehow. I fine OS X much more intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing. Some apps written for it, however, fall far short it it&#8217;s high mark.</p>
<p>ecto is a blogging application for OS X, and it&#8217;s plain. It&#8217;s not minimalist-chic. It&#8217;s not &#8220;sleek&#8221;. It&#8217;s boring and plain. It also isn&#8217;t intuitive, unfortunately. It&#8217;s got loads of features, but it misses its greatest asset: the fact that it&#8217;s built on the most advanced <a class="zem_slink" title="Graphical user interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/Graphical_user_interface">Graphic User Interface</a> ever developed.</p>
<p>Strangely, <a href="http://www.zachbeauvais.com/archives/windows-live-services-sucklook-nice-delete-as-appropriate/">I much prefer to blog using Windows Live Writer</a>! Its design works well, it&#8217;s interesting-looking (without being LOUD, like the rest of the intrusive Vista package) and it does what it says it will. It interacts very well with images (unlike ecto!), videos and links. It also has the ingenious feature of dowloading your site&#8217;s CSS so you can actually see how the post <em>should</em> look <em>in situ</em>. (Granted, this doesn&#8217;t always work&#8230;)</p>
<p>The point of this slightly oblique and poorly-thought-out rant, is that the point of software is to make peoples lives better. Designers completely miss that. Window&#8217;s OS designers seem to have thought: &#8220;I know, they want pretty. We&#8217;ll give &#8217;em pretty. It&#8217;ll be so pretty, it&#8217;ll need 3GB RAM and a high-end Graphics Card just to run&#8230; that&#8217;ll show &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s rubbish.</p>
<p>However, whoever was heading the design team for the Live suite (Writer, Mail, Messenger <em>et al</em>), was clearly desinging from an end-user&#8217;s perspective. Their thoughts were probably more along the lines of:</p>
<p>&#8220;hmm, when I blog, I like to be able to do that with images. Wouldn&#8217;t it be good if we could see how it&#8217;d look on the site before we publish? Yeah, Hey! I think people will find this useful&#8230; ooh, that looks good, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear how you get on when designing or using software. Being me, I don&#8217;t think it stops with software design, but is actually a feature of how we live and interact. Let me know&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just watched the most unhelpful but beautifully-shot promotional video for the new <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/default.aspx?cc=GB&amp;lc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=US" target="_blank">Sony Ericsson XPERIA.</a> I assume it&#8217;s a mobile phone from the five-second glimpse you get of it. The rest of the video is a bit of a mystery. It&#8217;s very enjoyable to watch, so I&#8217;d recommend it. It&#8217;s got lots of paper aeroplanes flying around NYC, with a Mystery Tour song going round. </p>
<p>In seriousness, I read a review on Last 100 about it, but they were baffled by the marketing speak too&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>   The EXPERIA X1, available in the second half of 2008, is a &#8220;premium experience of energized communication&#8221;, whatever that means.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks fun, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what it will do; but I can&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t feel a bit sad that it&#8217;s Windows Mobile. The limited experience I&#8217;ve had with WinMobiles has been poor, really. I don&#8217;t really want my mobile phone to pause and hang like my PC does&#8230; However, I love Sony&#8217;s hardware, and this looks rather fun&#8230;</p>
