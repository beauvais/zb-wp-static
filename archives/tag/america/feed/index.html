								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The internet is full of information of dubious quality, and I have recently spent quite a bit of time trawling a particular subsection of this by trying to trace family information. I have found many lists of names, and I appear to be lucky that my maternal side seems to have been recorded doing things (been born, married, and buried in the main) for quite a long while. There is a frisson of expectation when climbing the family tree, hoping to find an interesting branch or two and praying not to find any thorns or rotten fruit. Certainly the most interesting character I have found so far was a bloke named Richard, and his story is one that stirs up something confusing to me.</p>
<h2>Richard Peyton Bailey</h2>
<p>You see, Richard Bailey – my seventh or so great grandfather – was born in Lancashire around 1740. One story says he was a carpenter, and he made the long voyage across the Atlantic as a young man to seek his fortune in Virginia. Nothing I have seen even hints at the motivation for this travel, but several of his family made the journey as well: his father and possibly even grandfather made the same journey. For whatever reason, he settled in a place that I remember visiting as a child, a part of the world which would later become West Virginia. He and his family were pioneers of Western Virginia, long before the time that would split the West from the rest of Virginia.</p>
<p>He seemed to have lived a vivid and dangerous life. He defended his family and friends from Indian attacks, and built a structure called &#8220;the fort&#8221; that seemed to have been a long-lasting local landmark. His family settled and set-up and set about creating the kind of America that I learned about in my school lessons in US history. His was an archetype of American life: so much so, it almost feels that but for a twist of fate, we could all have learned about Richard Peyton Bailey instead of Daniel Boone. When we sang &#8220;Land where my fathers died&#8230;&#8221; it never struck me at the time just how many of my fathers had done their perishing in America.</p>
<p>It was another story that was most exciting. A single line from a document stored on a genealogical site:</p>
<p>&#8220;He served in the Virginia Militia as a spy during the Revolutionary War between 1776 and 1783.&#8221;</p>
<p>If this is true, Richard Peyton Bailey, my great grandfather fought in <em>The</em> American war in the very regiment commanded by a certain George Washington, Godfather of all American symbol-folk and the fellow on quarters and dollar bills.</p>
<p>There is no way of knowing whether Richard was a man who fought for a cause or a creed. He could have been a mercenary, or a conscript (though I have some doubts that a commander would trust a draftee as a spy). I cannot ask him whether he <em>believed</em> in a land of freedom (from monarchy) and bravery (in the face of tyranny), or whether he approved of using Boston Harbour as a teapot. But his life is symbol enough. He was to leave the old country of England, and build a wildly independent life with his own two carpenter&#8217;s hands. He would defend it by all means, even against the forces of the land of his birth. He would leave his family an inheritance of freedom.</p>
<h2>But I&#8217;m not a Republican</h2>
<p>For me, Lancashire is now a couple hours up the M6. It is the county of my wife&#8217;s family, and I&#8217;ve spent time visiting her relatives less than 20 miles from where my 7th 8th and 9th great grandfathers-Bailey were born, Christened and sometimes married. My wife was born there.</p>
<p>I shall be publishing this piece on a day that I wonder how Richard would have celebrated: a British Royal Wedding. I imagine him issuing me a rebuke in a heavy Lancastrian accent, refusing to lift his glass with me in toast. He is far removed from me in time, but his symbolic life is at the heart of a mindset opposed to Monarchy. That is part of my heritage: leaving kingdoms to join a republic, build a new life, and to defend it.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not a Republican. At least, I have no particular aversion to the British form of monarchy. I am instinctively drawn to its sense of stability, and its wholly different symbolic tradition. I do not find the idea of living under an autocratic regime appealing, of course. And I have no doubt that it was the powerful grinding away of the royal office over centuries that we are left with the polished and relatively non-offensive institution of the current monarchy. There is, however, something stable in the idea that the head of state has been raised and trained to office from childhood. In a time of short-term professional politics, the heritage and context of political and symbolic positions being woven into family encourages me.</p>
<p>This, then, leaves me in a bit of a bind. I am drawn to the stability and heritage of British royalty but I am equally repelled by its seemingly mindless adoration from arch-conservatives and the cultural baggage that comes with it. The benign symbols to which I am drawn become something hideous in the publications of the nationalists and bigots. They become something, in the unlikely hands of the American &#8220;Tea Party&#8221;, that is altogether reprehensible.</p>
<p>I also think about this event in more human terms. There are strong elements of the intrusive, the voyeuristic, and imperfect catharsis in the ubiquitous Royal coverage. Everything is recorded, broadcast and consumed. From my relatively sequestered channel of social media, I have read about the dress, the carriage, the cost, the Queen and the bride&#8217;s family. The papers publish every detail, and their commentaries are full of criticism on grounds of cost, taste, politics, and seemingly whim. From people minutely dissecting every possible aspect of what otherwise should be a celebration of a day.</p>
<p>It is a wedding, and I was not invited. What right have I to see and comment and titter and snarl.</p>
<p>As disturbing as the adoration of bigots may be, and as much as any may have a political stance against monarchy, or a justifiable complaint, you demean yourself by being&#8230; by being simply rude.</p>
<h2>To be Upstanding</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beauvais/4963786782/in/photostream"><img class="alignright" width="500" height="334" alt="photo of champagne glass" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/4963786782_9eb7760190.jpg?resize=500%2C334" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>So, today will not be watching the Royal Wedding. Partly this is due to my not having a TV, but mostly because I would feel like I were gatecrashing an event to which I was not invited. On balance, however, and in light of the official and public nature of the occasion, I will be lifting my glass and throwing a party. I shall wish my best to the new Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. I shall pray for their wisdom, and for their future reign. I shall pray that they make it safely through the mindless criticism of the rude reformer and the unwanted baggage from the unwanted fanatics. I shall bear in mind my own inheritance of equality and think on the past reigns of less welcome monarchs, and hope for the balance of stability they might, in their official role, bring to the world.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Friends very often ask whether I feel myself to be American or whether I&#8217;m English yet; and I find I always stammer a bit, and hedge.</p>
<p>Do I feel like an American?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>I spent the first 18 years of my life in Colorado, so you could say I&#8217;m definitely American. But it also means that every post 18-year-old thing I&#8217;ve done has been carried out on foreign soil. My childhood was American: Thanksgiving, baseball, and some kind of vague but persistant instinct to salute and tear up when I hear the Star-Spangled Banner.</p>
<p>But my adulthood has been British: married life, university, career and (the more I think about it) mindset. Even using the word &#8220;foreign&#8221; is difficult: I often think of the US as a foreign country. I say &#8220;we&#8221; when I talk about England playing rugby, but also &#8220;we&#8221; when I think I&#8217;m correcting a misconception about America. I&#8217;ve caught myself saying &#8220;we&#8221; meaning &#8220;Americans&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221; meaning &#8220;Brits&#8221; in the same sentence. I suppose I&#8217;m grateful I don&#8217;t also have to say &#8220;oui&#8221; to include my family name in my confused national identity.</p>
<p>Politically, I seem to see the US as something foreign, something other than mine. And I&#8217;ve felt this recently like no other time while watching stories about the &#8220;Tea Party,&#8221; and the bludgeoning of the American progressive movement at the previous mid-term elections. I supported Obama two years ago almost entirely because I saw him as the best candidate for America&#8217;s perception abroad. Europe does not understand conservative America, it cannot see the charm in folksy anecdotes and it cringes when Sarah Palin speaks. It&#8217;s as foreign to the rest of the world as a pungent delicacy or disinclination to queue. So, regardless of what I may or may not consider to be reasonable US domestic policy, I can see that certain aspects of American culture do not translate well. Obama translates well: his administration simply makes more sense to the rest of the world, while still being hopefully and enthusiastically American.</p>
<p>A conversation on Facebook brought this into focus when a friend asked how America is perceived abroad. I hope that my own position might help others understand both cultures better, but I&#8217;m also more aware than ever that my own perception is confused. I hope what follows might help both of understand America from outside.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important thing to understand about the way the US is understood is that it isn’t, but people feel they do. Through TV, music, film and multi-national organisations (Starbucks, McDonalds, KFC etc), many people in the UK think they are familiar with American culture. This is probably true in reverse: through music, TV formats, film and a vague feeling of historical connection. Through media, ideas like: rich, racially-tense, belligerent, generous, loud, capitalistic, introspective, neurotic, extraverted and untraveled are associated in the British mind with America.</p>
<p>This sense of familiarity can make it difficult to explain that the US is extremely heterogeneous. Its political, racial, cultural, historical and geographic differences would make the average European’s head spin. These are differences a European would experience through travelling across different countries, not through a single nation. It’s hard to express adequately to a British audience how far apart say: Seattle and New Orleans are culturally, or that New York City is hugely different even from the rest of New York State (though this may resonate with London, which is also very different from anywhere outside the M25).</p>
<p>But, there is something about being American, about resonating with a strong national ideal that is certainly seen. The US is paradoxically very American, despite its diversity. There&#8217;s a patriotism and an optimism that is understood but is confusing: it&#8217;s admired and distrusted at the same time.</p>
<p>American foreign affairs have been watched with extreme discomfort and apprehension: the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were extremely controversial in the UK. Tony Blair’s decision to take the UK into combat without the remit of the UN was seen as following too closely in America’s wake. A lot of the satire here from a few years ago featured Tony Blair as a self-conscious lacky to George Bush’s violent and bumbling foreign policy.</p>
<p>Social divisions within the US are noticed but not understood. Coming from a relatively poor part of the US, it’s difficult to hear people talking about rich Americans as if there are no other kinds. I don’t know if this is something that’s completely part of the stereotype, but it&#8217;s probably safe to say that although the US is certainly relatively rich, the difference between rich and poor are huge and not necessarily understood outside the States—or inside, for that matter.</p>
<p>It is probably true that American culture contains something in particular that is difficult for the British to like: it takes itself seriously. I think that Americans generally have a higher opinion of their own culture than the British do of theirs. That’s not to say that Brits aren’t proud to be so, but that they seem to be more tempered and also make light of the foibles they know about. A lot of British humour, for example, is self-deprecating and makes fun of itself for how it must be perceived abroad. Americans more easily default to seeing the rest of the world as foreign, and seeing itself from another perspective is harder. This, even as I type it, brings out another conflict, however. It is probably more true of &#8220;middle America&#8221;—of the South, the MidWest and the Southwest—than it is of the coasts. But, I do think it is broadly applicable to American culture as a whole.</p>
<p>Some truths are better understood, but still only partially: America is seen as not caring about its poor because of its system of non-public healthcare provision and social services. It’s shocking to people that anyone would have to pay for emergency medical treatment, or be saddled with debt through misfortune. The American misunderstanding of socialism is seen as silly: anything socially beneficial is seen in the US almost instantly as socialism (this is something that’s at least true in the conservative parts of the US) and therefore evil. I don&#8217;t think most Americans know the difference between socialism and liberalism or progressivism. It&#8217;s not a distinction I made very well until far more recently than I care to admit.</p>
<p>It’s probably true that the average Brit knows far more about America than the average American knows about just about anywhere else. In a pub this very week, I overheard a conversation which ended with an old standby of fireside bollocks-merchants that happens to be unfortunately true: most Americans don’t have passports. America is introspective, putting America first, and not fully understanding that the rest of the world doesn&#8217;t really see it that way. It&#8217;s probably the case (I don&#8217;t have any statistics to hand) that more Brits have met Americans than Americans have met non-American.</p>
<p>People who travel to the US, or who meet many Americans will be more familiar with the complexity of being American. They may be likely to say that Americans are generous, hospitable, friendly and gregarious, as well as shockingly ignorant of the rest of the world. I have heard some hugely funny stories-one even included me, when one of my relatives asked my wife what language she spoke in London!</p>
<p>British travellers to America often talk about friendly waiters and portion sizes being shockingly huge. On my last trip, after ordering a steak, I tried to work out how they had mistaken my order for a single meal for a request to feed a family of four.</p>
<p>People can only see through the lenses they have access to, I guess, and the things that bring America into focus come through pop music, movies, large companies, TV and news. America cannot be ignored by the rest of the world: it&#8217;s too big and has too much economic influence. So it&#8217;s covered in world news, and it&#8217;s talked about in pubs. I think that through its huge presence, and by travelling more, many Brits probably do understand many of the differences I&#8217;ve outlined above. But I think that even many well-traveled Brits find it hard to see from the perspective of Middle America.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found it helpful writing this, because it&#8217;s shown me something very important about the way I think. I feel American sometimes, and feel familiar with it. But I don&#8217;t feel at home there or with the unqualified label of &#8220;American&#8221;. It&#8217;s very like walking past an old house: you immediately remember what it&#8217;s like to live there, but you don&#8217;t recognise the flowers or the dog. It&#8217;s under new management, and it feels odd to trespass.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/twitter_banned_from_white_house.php">read</a> yesterday that twitter has been banned from the White House. In the post, Marshall Kirkpatrick joked that this could be a reason we haven&#8217;t seen much from Obama&#8217;s twitter stream recently. I must admit however, my initial reaction was sympathetic with the White House for pragmatic reasons, though the attitude of the Press Secretary&#8217;s attitude towards &#8220;twitterers&#8221; did raise the hackles. It makes sense to be secure in the White House, to make sure people aren&#8217;t saying things which could be dangerous or cause scandal through carelessness. &#8220;Loose lips sink ships&#8221;, don&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>But I think there is a wider idea here, which I think I&#8217;ve glimpsed between the lines.</p>

I use it to pass on little observations, like you might to a room full of mates, when there isn&#8217;t anyone there to share with directly. News of Michael Jackson&#8217;s death reached me via an off-colour joke on twitter. These are uses for a technology which it would be difficult to commend.</p>
<p>However, I also use twitter to share news. When my grandfather recently passed away, I received dozens of messages of encouragement and sympathy. Several of us here in Shropshire organise a monthly get together to network and discuss tech-trends and the work we do through the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/shropgeek">@shropgeek</a>. Important announcements at work, and shared interest groups often rely on twitter for their spread and response, and I&#8217;ve had customer service reps from big companies personally respond to my feedback. Of far more significance, the government of Iran was unable to stop twitter, allowing its citizens to tell the rest of the world what was going on when all other forms of communication were censored, blocked, or monitored. And citizens from around the rest of the world responded.</p>
<p>twitter is a medium, and suggesting someone is petty and fatuous because they use it is like suggesting everyone on TV is unimportant or vain. There is no connection between the inane talk-show host and the investigative journalist or head of state! The point is in the message, not the vehicle. But, the point this raises in my mind is that twitter, and other forms of web-enabled channels make for a high level of transparency, and I don&#8217;t think the US (in particular) is a power who likes transparency at the moment.</p>
<p>This has lead me to question what I think of the use of web-media by politicians and important figures, particularly in the US and UK. It makes me wonder whether the &#8220;Loose lips&#8221; philosophy is misguided in the modern world. You see, closing channels, blocking communication, and monitoring messages suggests a democracy that doesn&#8217;t trust its citizens with the truth. Sure, there are controls and securities which must be in place, and I&#8217;m not suggesting for a moment that every clerk should have a constitutional right to twitter state-secrets&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;or am I?</p>
<p>You see, the United States is global super-power on par with, and probably only directly comparable with great states of the past called Empires. The notion of an emperor of the US would chill the blood of most of my family, and thinking of the US as anything but a &#8220;democracy&#8221; is practically heresy. After all, citizens&#8217; rights are ensconced in the very foundation myth and history of the US itself. &#8220;We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal&#8230;&#8221; begins a letter to a despotic monarch, sparking off the touch-pad for liberating men from the rule of figureheads, class and social bondage. But part of this very myth* that the Republic, &#8220;of the people, by the people and for the people&#8221; should be based on citizenship trusted to look after themselves and even take up arms to defend their status as such citizens. There is a deep-running notion in the American psyche that if the government were ever to get too big for it&#8217;s boots, it is the right—nay, duty—of her citizens to act to reduce her power.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t believe the US is a state that can be corrected by its citizens very effectively at all.  I think of the complexity, size, presence and byzantine nature of the US Government, and I feel disconnected, small, and powerless to change anything. Over the past decade, in the name of security, Americans put up with reductions in liberty, and I think this principle is bleeding through the cracks in the facade of governance. Blocking channels is saying: &#8220;we don&#8217;t trust you&#8221;.</p>
<p>What would a country look like where the public had access to the vast majority of government information? Where government officially made use of the media its citizens used? Where government officials were held accountable via the various media whenever they were caught being mis-represented?</p>
<p>Oddly, I think it&#8217;s the UK.</p>
<p>The &#8220;traditional&#8221; media here are a powerful force. It is seen as a near human right to have intimate news of public officials and dealings, and watching politicians being interviewed by members of the press is like eaves-dropping on a job interview or witnessing a cautious father&#8217;s first meeting of a prospective suitor for his only daughter. The press is a force to be reckoned with here, and it&#8217;s not seen as the trustworthy force itself, but is is composed of citizens, not officials.</p>
<p>Does this scandalise the government? Yes&#8230; and no. There is a very different attitude toward elected officials here, which doesn&#8217;t translate easily to American. A Member of Parliament is legally referred to as &#8220;Honourable Member&#8221;, but the &#8220;honourable&#8221; is not taken as read by the average Brit. For decades, for example, Members of Parliament have enjoyed a system of expenses whereby they can claim for nearly every cost of living: from second homes to food and utilities. The true level of this feeding-trough has recently been blown wide by the press (who subsequently have been enjoying their own self-congratulatory feast, but that is another post.)</p>
<p>But, I think the UK get the web, probably because it&#8217;s used to dealing with powerful media. I follow Number 10 Downing Street (the metonymic residence of the Prime Minister) on twitter. No 10 doesn&#8217;t say much, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to expose any state secrets, but I like the fact that it&#8217;s there to be engaged. The Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) hosts an important blog which outlines the government&#8217;s plans to expose public data for normal, every-day citizens to have a play with and to see what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>And, in the last few weeks, the Prime Minister himself has turned himself around almost 180º in my personal opinion. He represents a party for whom I have less time than either of the other major contenders, and I&#8217;ve rather lazily accepted him as an incompetent oaf. But, he&#8217;s finally earned my pint and invite to dinner, if not my vote (if any of his secretaries are reading this, just tweet your acceptance, and I&#8217;ll find some pheasants and Pinotage). A few weeks ago, he appointed Sir Tim Berners-Lee to a Parliamentary advisory role with the explicit intention of opening up and pushing public data online. This is a <strong>major</strong> point, because it leads to transparency through public accountability. There seems to be a movement for Parliament to see public data as belonging to the people who bought it with their taxes, and this seems to be the most democratic way to see it. His recent <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/gordon_brown.html">TED talk</a> also made me think he&#8217;s got a lot more to say than he perhaps has to date; though I think many of his points raise more questions than they answer.</p>
<p>Much has been said in the online world about the new American administration&#8217;s use of social media and the web to mobilise supporters during the election. But there hasn&#8217;t been much since. President Obama launched <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/www.data.gov">data.gov</a>, but there is very little data there. I think the web is seen as a tool for messages, as a part of a bigger campaign, and as a security breach. It&#8217;s something to be used with your own agenda, and only under one&#8217;s own strict parameters. And, perhaps most non-democratically, it&#8217;s been used to broadcast and to cajole—It has not been used to engage. The fact that social media have barely been touched since the election could point to a wider attitude that citizens only matter for the brief time they&#8217;re required to vote.</p>
<p>The UK has already exposed much of its public data, and it&#8217;s planning to publish more and more as Linked Data (machine-readable, immediately useful resources), and it&#8217;s made plans to be more open, grasping the web and the transparency it&#8217;s brought through the hard lessons that spin is impossible with a well-informed citizenry, and on the Open Web, there is less room for your own message than there is for humanity.</p>
<p>*<em>mythos is greek for &#8220;story&#8221;, and it is from that perspective I use the word <em>myth</em>: that it conveys the notion of a commonly-held understanding, not that it is entirely fantastic or without truth.</em></p>

<div style="width: 212px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/Image:Haliaeetus_leucocephalus2.jpg"><img title="Adult landing on nest" src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/202px-Haliaeetus_leucocephalus2.jpg?resize=202%2C252" alt="Adult landing on nest" width="202" height="252" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>
</div>
<p>This morning, after switching on the kettle, I set my laptop on the kitchen surface and shuffled through the BBC iPlayer&#8217;s &#8220;Factual&#8221; category—looking for something interesting to keep me company as I made my porridge and coffee. I stumbled across <em>Question Time</em>, and noticed that this special edition was being broadcast from the United States—something to do with an election? I was thrilled to discover the entire panel was American, with the notable exception of a personal hero of mine: British professor of history at Columbia University <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/7658904.stm">Simon Schama</a>.</p>
<p>Things, however, did not go according to plan, and I was very soon restraining myself from damaging my employers&#8217; Macbook with the wooden spoon I&#8217;d shortly before been using to stir my porridge. After realising that unless I switched off the iPlayer in short order, I&#8217;d either have to remove the spoon from the screen or from my clenched teeth.</p>
<p>I took a minute to reflect on my reaction.</p>
<p>As a quick introduction to <em>Question Time</em>, for my American readers—clearly something the audience at this recording had been denied—the format of the programme is straightforward. David Dimbleby chairs a panel of note-worthies, and selects from a series of questions submitted by the audience for the panel to answer one by one. It is a political programme which has featured many of the most important British figures including Tony Blair—while still Prime Minister. The panel usually consists of a politician or two, a political theorist or commentator (often an academic) and, often, a slightly more off-beat character such as <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/watch?v=EajKlwB30L0">Ian Hislop</a>.<br />
[blockquote type=&#8221;blockquote_quotes&#8221; align=&#8221;right&#8221;]Which candidate does the panel believe could and would restore America&#8217;s battered image abroad?&#8221;[/blockquote]
<p>Dimbleby: Which candidate does the panel believe could and would restore America&#8217;s battered image abroad?&#8221;</p>
<p>Schama: &#8220;Barak Obama&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Appreciative applause.</em></p>
<p>The historian then outlined his reasoning that the Democratic candidate&#8217;s heterogeneous past and perspective of global citizenship could only help America&#8217;s &#8220;perhaps undeserved,&#8221; tarnished foreign reputation. Specifically, Schama noted, the rhetoric of war as a last resort rather than an simply useful option could play an important role in diplomatic relationships.</p>
<p>One of the other panelists, this time from a more Republican-friendly platform, stated that he believed John McCain would fulfill this role more effectively.</p>
<p><em>Cheering, whooping, and a few boos.</em></p>
<p>The panelist then went on to outline why he thought the reputation of the US is not tarnished in some places abroad, and that many African nations actually admire American foreign policy. He also stated that Iraq could turn out to be a dramatic success. Each of the rest of the panelists then discussed their preferences and reasoning.</p>
<p>Several audience members were then asked their views, and this is when my breakfast  began to take a less supportive role in my morning. One man was asked who he&#8217;d like to see in the White House, and his emphatic response of &#8220;John McCain&#8221; brought whoops and cheers before he could speak more of his mind.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, he did speak more.</p>
<p>With a notably impressive display of condescending superiority, the gentleman in an expensive suit addressed Simon Schama, beginning with: &#8220;You&#8217;re a typical professor. You are it. With all respect, our country is not hated overseas, I&#8217;ve been to fifty-five countries&#8230;&#8221; continuing that the US &#8220;brings hope to people&#8221; and that it is not hated overseas. &#8220;We&#8217;re the most charitable nation on earth, as evidenced by George Bush, and all the work he did&#8230;&#8221;</p>
[blockquote type=&#8221;blockquote_quotes&#8221; align=&#8221;left&#8221;]We are respected and loved by millions of people BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DO FOR THEM! AND WE DIE FOR THEM, AND WE DIE FOR THEM![/blockquote]
<p>His tone then took on a challenging note: &#8220;with all respect, don&#8217;t talk about our country being villafied overseas, when we are respected and loved by millions of people BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DO FOR THEM. [emphasis his, as he shouted over the cascade of applause and the chairman&#8217;s attempts to direct the discussion.] &#8220;AND WE DIE FOR THEM, AND WE DIE FOR THEM.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was already impressed by this increasingly visceral outburst, when he capped his performance with a patronisingly disgusted gesture allowing the typical professor his reply. As Schama began his response, the suited gentleman continued his tirade, raising his voice over the top of audience and Schama&#8230; and it all continued to escelate until eventually, Schama was able to say &#8220;if I&#8217;m a typical professor, you&#8217;re a typical blowhard; let me finish.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spoon, by now, was nowhere near the pan, and I found myself gawping at the screen in irrational hope that the man would shut up.</p>
<p>The problem, from my perspective, is not about which candidate wins this election, nor from which side of an all-but-imaginary political fence one happens to stare through. The problem is the offensive-defence of American rhetoric. It&#8217;s pre-emptive, visceral, and primitive. It makes respectable-looking people speak without thought. It damages credibility, and makes the speaker look like a bafoon. And I remember it firsthand.</p>
[blockquote type=&#8221;blockquote_line&#8221; align=&#8221;right&#8221;]The problem with this is that facts are tactical, discussion conduit, and people incidental.[/blockquote]
<p>Having been raised in the States, I know the blood-pounding-in-the-ears nature of political discussion. The goal is to be right, absolutely; and to make sure anyone watching knows you&#8217;re the <em>right</em> one. The problem with this is that facts are tactical, discussion conduit, and people incidental  It&#8217;s all a vehicle for your personal perspective (the right one) to be broadcast with as little ambiguity as possible. And this kind of debate might even lead to interesting dichotomies and contrasts if it wasn&#8217;t all done under the influence of adrenaline.</p>
<p>You see, from an outsider&#8217;s perspective, this suited businessman illustrated America. &#8220;We&#8217;re right!&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;re the most charitable!&#8221; &#8220;We fought for you!&#8221; &#8220;We freed Iraq, goddammit!&#8221; and: &#8220;We&#8217;re not hated abroad! Don&#8217;t tell me we&#8217;re hated, don&#8217;t <strong>you</strong> talk about <strong>our</strong> country&#8230;&#8221; The logical element of the discussion is abandoned, and it&#8217;s down to bare-knuckles. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand your words, man, cause my ears are throbbing, so I&#8217;m gunna <strong>SHOUT</strong> at you so I can hear my <strong>own damn voice</strong>!&#8221;</p>
<p>My response surprised me: I <em>tsk</em>ed, and muttered: &#8220;typical American, can&#8217;t see he&#8217;s trying to <em>tell</em> the world what <em>it</em> thinks.&#8221; I appreciated the irony of this hateful person insisting we&#8217;re not hated. I found the fact that a professor&#8217;s extraordinary career and the phrase &#8220;with all due respect&#8221; could be used as conduits for hatred actually quite funny. I would have laughed and enjoyed a British moment of personal, quiet exultation in the foolishness of the speaker if it hadn&#8217;t been for one thing.</p>
<p>The audience.</p>
<p>The audience rose to this diatribe with a fervency of whooping, cheering, clapping and shouting. The whole place suddenly became a bowl of people shouting down the suited man, the panel, Dimbleby and each other. I stood gobsmacked in my kitchen—spoon dripping oats onto the cat—and begged God not to let any of my friends watch this.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t watch it any longer; I switched it off and cried.</p>
<p>The thing that many Americans don&#8217;t realise, is that the rest of the world is watching what they do—but not out of jealousy or pride. Decisions and perspectives made in the country with the largest economy on the planet affect the rest of us, so we&#8217;re watching reasonably closely to get a glimpse of the future through the decisions being made now. And most of us can&#8217;t comprehend just how any decisions are made under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Until Americans are willing to put emotional defensiveness and denial aside from their rhetoric, there will be a continued decline in their perception overseas: regardless of political perspective, good deeds or noble willingness to sacrifice. And, by the way, America as a concept <em>is</em> hated by some people overseas. We need to deal with it, not shout them down or question their right to not like us very much.</p>
<p>And, the question came again to me: &#8220;Where are all the considerate, contempletative Americans I knew growing up? Where are the people who give more generously than any other nation? Where are the peace-makers and volunteers? Where are the AIDS workers, teachers, and nurses?&#8221; I only pray that when the hubris of the TV-talkers dies, the dignity I know lives on in the US is left standing.</p>
