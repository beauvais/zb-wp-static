								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/4065636902"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 10px;" src="https://i0.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/4065636902_7e7bd7caae_m.jpg?w=1090" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I&#8217;m sat downstairs in my house in Shropshire, sipping Rioja and listening to Green Day and trying to imagine music which more resonates with the decade in which we of Orwell&#8217;s blight came of age. This is the last year of the &#8217;90s being only last decade. Everyone born in the &#8217;70s will soon be at least 30, and everyone in the 80&#8217;s will be in their 20&#8217;s; and a generation of kids is already asking: &#8220;Pearl Jam?&#8221; Another turning point, another fork stuck in the road&#8230;</p>
<p>So, was the decade before last good riddance? Was it worth all the while? I need to change the song, hang on&#8230;</p>
<p>I did most of my conscious growing up in the decade between shoulder-pads and Thundercats and the WWW. But has much changed? Am I too young to be talking nostalgically about 1990, or are you (if you thought that) getting older than you&#8217;d care to admit?</p>
<p>It may be lazy thinking, but I seem to picture the 1990&#8217;s as a decade of lasts. It was the last decade in which one could smoke in restaurants, and I am of the last generation which will remember hazy rooms filled with acrid plumes. I&#8217;ve lived my whole life thinking of the 1960&#8217;s as being the last decade of innocence—as the countless documentaries have explored—but I&#8217;m not convinced. Partly, I suppose, because everyone who can remember anything of significance from that period is middle-aged, and it&#8217;s difficult to imagine anyone over 45 being all that innocent. But I think something has changed since the 90&#8217;s. The ever-shrinking world of the 20th century seems to have expanded once again. Surely, the fallen towers in New York have become a gateway to a time before the Patriot Act and general fear and doubt; but I feel I&#8217;ve watched the country of my birth becoming less and less sure of itself and more terrified and confused since the end of the 90&#8217;s. Ah, maybe that&#8217;s it?</p>
<p>I left only a year after Y2K and the Millennium Bug ruined civilisation, and have been observing the US with the eyes of the 1990&#8217;s. <em>My</em> world has been getting bigger, and possibly less scary in comparison. The more people I meet and the more I hear their stories, the more I feel the world isn&#8217;t as scary nor as closed-off. Different has become less frightening to me.</p>
<p>What has this got to do with the 1990&#8217;s? I&#8217;m not sure, really. It was the last decade in which I called myself an American without having to think twice. It was the decade before I started to watch the US turn in on itself from outside its—increasingly armed—borders.</p>
<p>I wonder whether out parents would think of the 90&#8217;s as a decade of lasts? Would it be a decade of middles?</p>
