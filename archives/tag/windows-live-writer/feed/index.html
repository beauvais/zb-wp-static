								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reviews of new Windows releases always seem to say the same thing, depending on what kind of person writes them. Mac enthusiasts say it’s yet again stolen more MacOS features. Microsofties defend the new-found stability and the speed compared to last editions. Non-techies say how pretty this one is in comparison with the last, <em>et cetera</em>. </p>
<p>Well, I’ve got a preview build of Windows 7, and I’d like to give you a three-way look at it.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>Windows 7 already feels stronger and faster than Vista. It installed easily using Bootcamp, and is happily running on my MacbookPro. When I got all the drivers working (to be expected running on an Apple, I suppose) it’s robust and more or less respectable. This particular build/driver combination is particularly nice, because it’s got some special Apple drivers which let it play nice with my keyboard and F-button settings (volume, keyboard and screen brightness, eject).</p>
<p>Windows found my external display fairly quickly, though it would not use it’s full resolution at first. Then, randomly, it let me do so (though nothing had been downloaded or tweaked—it couldn’t; I had yet to connect to my network!). This was a nice surprise, but I kind of wish it would let me choose what’s going on instead of hiding its preferences and features in the background (more on this later).</p>
<p>A slight improvement over Vista is the ease by which Windows 7 seemed to handle getting online. It’s a breeze to select a wireless network and get connected. I also like some of the more subtle things they’ve done with 7, which make it a bit more pleasant to use such as the way they’ve layed-out the control panel settings, and the better file-layout in the navigation panels of explorer windows.</p>
<p>By far, so far, the best thing has been the speed. Windows 7, at this stage, is fast enough to work nicely. I don’t know how it will do after months of updates, registry bloat, and anti-malware software; but it MUST be better than Vista in this regard. Finally, however, is a small thing that I like: Windows Live Writer. It’s great! It’s available for Vista, however, so it’s not new. However, the Live Essentials on this version seem a bit easier to get going and running. Windows Live Writer is the only application that I wish I had on the Mac, and it’s still the best blogging tool out there.</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>Firstly, why is networking with Windows so hard? It found my router, got onto the internet, and updated itself fine. It talks with the Windows Mothership on the cloud easily enough. Would it, however, find my Mac on the same network? My iPhone? Yes… through Bluetooth! When will Windows start to recognise they need to make networking easy for users?</p>
<p>Secondly, this is basically Vista done not-so-badly. It’s, so far, what Vista should have been. Light (ish), easy, stable. But, to me, these are table-stakes. It’s not that impressive to say: “Our operating system doesn’t hang when you use default features! It’s stable, It’s easy!” It should be, why are you so proud of this?</p>
<p>The final reason why this isn’t going to be the best OS out there, however, is that it’s still Windows. Now, before you label me a fanboy or anti-establishmentarian; let me say why this is a problem. There are countless menus and features and settings and objects on this system. There are too many, unconnected settings. Windows Control Panel has 63 icons! OSX, in comparison, makes do with 26. The user also doesn’t often see an immediate effect from a settings change. After several sets of “OK” are pressed, I find out my network adapter’s been disabled, and have to go though a completely different route to get it back. The language used to describe the setup options has always been difficult to follow. Consider the Networking setup: Some based on actions, so you can “set up a new connection or network;” “connect to a network;” “fix network problem” etc. Others are categorical ‘HomeGroup,” “Internet Options,” “Wireless Network Connection” etc… I’ve had to go through every single one of them, and many subsequent menus besides in order to setup my home network. The “wizard” does nothing. It’s always been this way with Windows…you are expected to know exactly where the settings are hidden within some obscure menu, but you’re teased with easy options along the way. My favourite screen so far has been one which says: “Troubleshooting could not identify the problem.” Thanks for the help…</p>
<p>This problem stems from always being the Least Common Denominator. What results is that every set of functions is a compromise of some kind.</p>
<h2>The Not-Ugly but unfortunately Not-Original</h2>
<p>It’s not a new thing to say that this version of Windows is copying Mac. I grew up being told that Windows has stolen every good idea it’s ever had from someone else. While this may have been true with many things, I can’t believe they have never had an original thought. Despite its many shortcomings, Microsoft’s software is the market dominator, and has been for as long as anyone can remember. Sure, they’ve bought companies and talent along the way (so has Google… so has Apple!), but the Live stuff is pretty different, and works decently (except for its annoying insistence that all the services you use should be MS—a characteristic it shares with Apple services like MobileMe.)</p>
<p>Having a look at the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/windows-7" target="_blank">promotional video</a> for VistaII—I mean, Windows 7—and I’m struck by how little there is to say about it.</p>
<p>Firstly: “Windows Gurus”? Tell me that’s not a play on “Apple Geniuses”. You can imagine the board meeting that chose that name: “Right, we need something of an authority on the matter that sounds brainy and starts with G, but isn’t ‘Genius.’ Wilkinson?” “Uh, er, guardian…guarantor…general… guru?”</p>
<p>They seem terribly proud about how the windows all have previews and there’s a brilliant new thing called a Task Bar! Windows has had a taskbar for years, this one just works a bit more like the Dock in OSX. That’s it, move along.</p>
<p>They’ve renamed the “Workgroup” the “Homegroup”, and it does the same thing. It’s tweaked, supposedly, but it’s just a network. I find myself wondering if this a reaction to the “I’m a Mac” ads? “This isn’t work, it’s home. We’ve renamed it, HOME, cause it’s not at work. Get it?”</p>
<p>IE has had a few features added, called “accelerators” which essentially allow for interaction with the web through the browser. It could be a great step, except that there are Firefox folks doing it so much better. Bit.Ly plugin allows for a huge range of interaction with data on the screen through Firefox.&#160; <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/" target="_blank">Ubiquity</a> on Firefox is a genuinely new way of blurring the web, our human interactions, and our machines. “Accelerators” just seem like a glorified right-click or contextual menu. There’s also “InPrivate Browsing” which turns off cookies and history. Guess what Safari has called this? “Private Browsing”. Go figure…</p>
<p>I know this is a preview release, but my overall impression is that Windows 7 should have been launched in 2006. This is great, for a Windows release, it works and pretty well so far. Aside from the basic problem that it is Windows, and works by being everything to everyone, it’s OK. But it’s not exciting, it’s not THAT new, and it feels a bit like we should be seeing a real breakthrough by now.</p>

<p>Gizmodo is a techblog with loads of interesting products. They have a complete set of <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/coffee" target="_blank" mce_href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/coffee">Coffee-tagged products</a>, all of which I want to own.</p>
<p>I have no idea why, but I&rsquo;ve got this thing for coffee gadgets. Every part of the kit appeals to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love coffee</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re gadgets</li>
<li>They involve an addictive process (like setting up a blogging engine)</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a type of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">lifehack</a></li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a considerable risk (you might get burned, or it might explode)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you have any coffee gadgets you&rsquo;d like to tell me about, please let me know!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. this is my first post ever using BlogJet&hellip; It&rsquo;ll probably also be my last, since it&rsquo;s virtually the same as Windows Live Writer, but costs&mdash;and isn&rsquo;t as pretty.</p>

There&#8217;s also a link in the navigation bar.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, Tim Ferris has decided <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/why-i-started-punching-jerks-again">to start punching people</a>. I know, shocking. I have often thought about this, and thought about the consequences of actually carrying out my own form of impromptu corporal justice. To me, three thoughts rise from this idea:</p>
<p>1st, and slightly cliche&#8217;: &#8220;Where would it all end?&#8221; With only a personal standard of right and wrong, where does the line get drawn? There would inevitably be situations in which my view of the right reaction would be in conflict with someone else. No doubt, this would almost always be at odds with the person I decide to punch. What constitutes a &#8216;punching offense&#8217;?</p>
<p>Second, there does seem to be, in both British and American society,</p>
<div id="scid:84E294D0-71C9-4bd0-A0FE-95764E0368D9:79a1918f-354d-43c8-8a12-fd54021f4a42" class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="display: inline; float: right; margin: 0px; padding: 5px 0px 5px 10px;"><a id="map-a553993e-7248-4258-a18d-b592daf1a30f" title="Click to view this map on Live.com" href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=skq229gzq70n&amp;lvl=1&amp;style=o&amp;scene=12453747&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;FORM=LLWR"></a><br />
<label style="font-size: .8em;" for="map-a553993e-7248-4258-a18d-b592daf1a30f">Caledonian Road, Kings Cross</label></div>
<p>a complete lack of regard for personal consequences in public. Having lived in Kings Cross, Central London, I&#8217;ve probably seen about the worst people have to offer. From middle-class, middle-aged men trawling the streets in posh cars for paid sex to drunk teenagers being violently sick or urinating on the street. Many times, while catching a bus to university or walking back home, I was forced to think about mine and my wife&#8217;s safety. We saw someone casually walk into a phone box and rip out the coin compartment. I was harassed almost daily by the drunk homeless who hurl abuse about themselves like Pigpen from Peanuts. This is a bleak picture, and we also witnessed people giving up large portions of their lives in drop-in centres or with the Salvation Army, befriending prostitutes and making a difference. More about that later. The point here is that there is not enough regard for others&#8217; dignity, and I must admit, I&#8217;ve often wondered if some sort of bodily reminder might stop someone&#8217;s abusive, uncaring actions.</p>
<p>Finally, what about them? I wonder if I&#8217;ve ever been in a position to merit a stout punch in the face? (This question is not directed at immediate family or my wonderful spouse!) While at a stag do (bachelor party) a few weeks ago, I was concerned that our group  was being too loud. Granted, this was not a typically-rude party, and most people were sober enough to walk the half-mile or so back to their hotel, but we were being very loud in a small pub. At one stage, the best man was performing his duty of making an ass of the lot of us by slapping another member of the stag party firmly on the arse while shouting: &#8220;Whoopah!&#8221;. Anyone who&#8217;s met the best man will know his voice booms out like Brian Blessed, and the older gentlemen at the table next to us did actually shout for us to be quiet. (Most of us couldn&#8217;t hear above the &#8220;Whoopah!&#8221;) Had I been trying to enjoy a quiet chat and pint in a wonderful Tudor pub, and the table next began shouting like this, I might have been tempted to punch a few faces myself.</p>
<p>So, will I start punching jerks again? On balance, I don&#8217;t think so. I&#8217;d have only myself to answer to, and I know who I am, and that I am not infallible. I&#8217;ve also made mistakes, and wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to have been punched for them all. On the other hand, there does seem to be a lack of respect going around, for which a normal citizen has very little recourse. What do you do when a hippie spits on you? Well, since the problem is systemic, there seems to be only one course of action: make the system better. Those volunteers in a Kings Cross drop-in centre were making a tangible difference, for absolutely no thanks. (The homeless they served treated the women as if it was only right for them to give up every morning to cook them breakfast and provide them with clothing!) And, we&#8217;re told to turn the other cheek. I can only think this is ever more relevant in a society losing its mind. There is no longer a social standard for issuing a challenge (though I can see its appeal), but there is an example to follow for those of us who follow Jesus, and it&#8217;s entirely counter-cultural:</p>
<blockquote><p>27-30&#8243;To you who are ready for the truth, I say this: Love your enemies. Let them bring out the best in you, not the worst. When someone gives you a hard time, respond with the energies of prayer for that person. If someone slaps you in the face, stand there and take it. If someone grabs your shirt, giftwrap your best coat and make a present of it. If someone takes unfair advantage of you, use the occasion to practice the servant life. No more tit-for-tat stuff. Live generously. (<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/?search=Luke%206:29;&amp;version=65;">Luke 6:27-30, Message</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Live generously. How the hell do we do that?</p>
<p>Also, I like this Windows Live Writer thing. It&#8217;s very Mac-like, ironically, and easy to use. It&#8217;s also a lot easier than logging into my CMS, but I haven&#8217;t seen how it posts yet. For that: here goes&#8230;</p>
