								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so I thought I&#8217;d try something. I thought I&#8217;d try writing an entire post on an iPhone. I&#8217;ve downloaded an app&#8230; Think it&#8217;s ingeniously called something like &#8220;blog writer&#8221;. I can tell that my typically long-winded style and use of punctuation will be a killer here! </p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, this feels easy. Whether that&#8217;s the second pint talking, however, would require further experimentation. </p>
<p>I should say: it&#8217;s easy enough to TYPE. Thinking at the same time, I feel, will take some time. So, my devoted reader, you&#8217;re in for a treat of mindlessness&#8230; </p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s as well getting used to using mobile interfaces, I think. With it being this painless to finally BE online through such a small portal leads me to think it&#8217;ll be a limited time before this is the default for simply connecting.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t THAT easy&#8230; It is so very much faster to type. But, this is fine, and it&#8217;ll only get better. However, there are some things which are necessary for this to be my default: </p>
<p>*I need the use of all my fingers. This screen is fantastically good-and I find it very much better as an interface even than my beloved trackball. But the keyboard&#8230; It&#8217;s too slow.</p>
<p>*Faster app switching. This will surely improve with time, but it&#8217;s a bit of a train-of-thought killer.</p>
<p>*Copy/paste. I mean: Come On!</p>
<p>*Finally, the way to navigate among text is to hold one&#8217;s finger somewhere near the text, and drop the resulting cursor somewhere near the letter. Arrows alongside this would be very useful. </p>
<p>So, there you have it: my first iPhone post. Not sure I&#8217;ll rush out to to it again. But it&#8217;s possible. I need more practice with the interface, but I&#8217;m not sure if I will. </p>
<p>One last thought: there&#8217;s limited to no file handling. This is a mistake, I think. I would very much hate to lose this much thumb-written text now&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/#comments">Engadget</a>, I noticed a post about much-rumoured &#8220;Google Phone&#8221;. Apparently, they have it on good authority that the people over at Google are working on their own Mobile OS. The interesting bit, though, is that Google has been working very closely with <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/www.apple.com">Apple </a>on the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/iphone">iPhone</a> project. If they launch their own Google Phone (gPhone, Googlephone, whatever&#8230;) they will be in direct competition.</p>
<p>What I wonder, however, is whether Google and Apple are playing even closer together. Imagine two companies more able to launch intuitive products and acquire companies and methods in order to put them to better use within a larger structure. Google, recently, has been launching its <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/a">Web Office</a> while hoovering up smaller developers to bring in the very best of web-based and hybrid (web/desktop) applications. What does Google need next?</p>
<p><b>Brilliant hardware.</b> Who builds better hardware than Apple?</p>
<p>This is only a guess, but what happens if Google and Apple work closer on mobile tech? Instead of direct competition (which would only result in a proliferation of one-upmanship devices and platforms with little long-term customer satisfaction) a JV of some description could result in the best of breed mobile devices (and why just mobile) with a very long shelf life!</p>
<p>What do you reckon?</p>
