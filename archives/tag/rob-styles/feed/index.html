<p>So, I&#8217;ve been &#8220;<a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/orecchiette-with-broccoli-and-anchovies">tagged</a>&#8221; by Rob Styles to post a recipe and pass on the goodness. I really enjoy cooking, but trying to write down a recipe that I like making is trickey. I tend to cook like recipes my Nanny (great-grandmother) handed down: &#8220;pinch of salt, splash of oil (pronounced roughly &#8220;all&#8221;), dash of nutmeg&#8221;. I&#8217;m also aware that there are many dishes I cook which tend to vary considerably, depending on what I happen to have.</p>
<p>So, since I live in the countryside, wear tweeds and wellies on occasion and own a flat-cap, I&#8217;ll have to post a recipe with pheasant!</p>
<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t too hard, cause pheasant&#8217;s taste wonderful! The only thing to remember when cooking them, is that they&#8217;re drier and more flavourful than chicken, so cooking them in ways which drain out juices is generally a poor way to proceed.</p>
<p>The following recipe is less a list of ingredients and well-laid-out cookbook instructions, but more of a narrative. The ingredients you can use vary very widely, and you can even cook it differently if you fancy. The basic idea, tho, is to combine apples and pheasants in a lovely, creamy dish!</p>
<p>So, to start, get some or all of the following (serves 2-3):</p>
<p>1 pheasant (which you can get &#8220;in the feather&#8221; for less than £2 per brace—that&#8217;s two birds—or cleaned for a couple quid)<br />
3-5 shallots<br />
Thyme (fresh is best)<br />
1 good-sized cooking apple<br />
Garlic<br />
Butter<br />
Calvados or brandy<br />
Butter<br />
Quality, dry cider (or white wine, if you Normandy to Hereford)<br />
Single Cream</p>
<p>You can proceed in several ways, right from the start. If you want a caserole-style dish, joint your bird first, and prepare all the ingredients in a caserole dish to bake in the oven. You can also cook it in a heavy, lidded pan on the stove, or in the slow cooker. I tend to leave the bird whole until it falls apart on the plates!</p>
<p>Heat some butter in a heavy, largish pan. Brown your well-seasoned bird, either the jointed chunks or manoeuvring the whole bird so it&#8217;s nice and golden. Just before it goes crispy (you&#8217;re trying to give it texture and colour, not fry it through) add finely-chopped shallots and garlic. As the onions get soft, slightly lower the heat and add a measure of brandy to flame. The best way is to pour it into a ladle, and warm it as you pour a bit of the brandy over the pheasant then light the liquor—pouring a little more at a time, without letting the flame follow into the ladle. Finally, once the flame goes out, chuck in some freshly-torn thyme and allow that to pop and fry for a minute or so.</p>
<p>Put the meat and onions into your caserole dish or slow-cooker,and de-glaze the pan with a little bit more brandy, pouring all the cooking juices back over the pheasant. Add the chunkily-sliced apple to the dish, and pour in some cider or white wine. I don&#8217;t give measures here, because it&#8217;s entirely up to you. If you want it to be a bit more stew-like, use more liquids, even adding some good poultry stock. Likewise, you can reduce it a bit more for a richer flavour.</p>
<p>Now cover and let it cook slowly. If you&#8217;re caseroling, it should take about an hour in a medium-hot oven. If you&#8217;re slow-cooking, it can take as long as you want beyond about 2 hours. Make sure, if you&#8217;ve gone for the slightly drier method, to baste the bird now and then, or add a knob of butter to the top to keep it nice and juicy.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s all cooked, remove the whole bird (if you&#8217;re using it jointed, ignore that) to rest.  Stir in your single cream, and let it warm through. Now, I depart with tradition here even further by not reducing everything down and blending all the apple/onions to a pureed oblivion. I simply halve the bird and serve with some roasted potatoes and seasonal veggies (also great on champ or mash!) and splash the juice and onions/apples alll over.</p>
<p>Drink: although this is a poultry dish, it will always be served in autumn or winter (pheasant season runs from September to February), so I tend to shy away from white wine. Also, pheasant is game, and has a richer flavour than most poultry people tend to eat, so I like this with a warming winter wine&#8230; maybe pinot noir? I&#8217;ve had it with pinotage and cabernet sauvignon (not mixed, but on two separate occasions) and it was rather nice.</p>
<p>The idea is to get all the flavour out of the pheasant without letting it dry out. This dish can be changed to be more like a stew with the addition of a flour roux and a bit more stock, or it can be reduced down to a lovely rich drizzle for a more fine-dining approach.</p>
