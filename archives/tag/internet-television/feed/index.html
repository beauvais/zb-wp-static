								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know this is behind the game, and that the bleeding edge of blog reviews has moved well beyond online streaming service Hulu (even though it&#8217;s not yet out to the public). But I received my beta invite last week and have had all this time to play around with it.</p>
<p>My initial thoughts: none.</p>
<p>No, not one initial thought. Hulu doesn&#8217;t work in the UK. They don&#8217;t tell you: &#8220;Hey, if you live in the UK, you will be able to access and begin your Hulu experience, but when you choose a show to stream, you&#8217;ll be disappointed. Have a nice day.&#8221; You have to jump through all the Beta hoops to get there first.</p>
<p>Now, I know I should have known better, being a generally web-savvy chap. But after a few pre-reviews of the Hulu service, I decided not to read any more blogs about it until after I&#8217;d tried it out myself. I knew not to expect too much, after reading the last review over at <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hulu-news-corp-and-the-web-2-0">Between the Lines</a> , but I wanted my own experience.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve found dozens of blogs about how bad it is that Hulu <a>doesn&#8217;t work in Europe</a>. Aside from whingeing about the lack of support, I can&#8217;t really think of anything more to write about Hulu (apart from its ridiculous, trying-too-hard-for-the-Web-2.0-market <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hulu-news-corp-and-the-web-2-0">name</a>).</p>
<p>But, doesn&#8217;t this kind of go against point of the web? The idea that we can make connections, share content, stream and connect?</p>
<p>The principle of the internet is broken by this experiment, and I don&#8217;t think a platform intended to be a YouTube killer should ever have been trialled in a geographically-limited network. Sure, I understand private Betas, but why limit this to the States? I don&#8217;t think News Corp really gets the Web 2.0 thing. In fact, I wonder if they really <i>get </i>the internet?</p>
<p>It reminds me of LaunchCast (now Yahoo Music). When I first launched the player, all the content was free, and there was absolutely loads of it. I was thrilled! Over months, however, content became harder to find due to advertisement interruptions and restrictions on skipping tracks. Suddenly, Launch re-directed to Yahoo, and I could no longer skip any content without upgrading to a premium service which hadn&#8217;t existed before. Then, when I moved to Britain, all the content was unavailable apart from a limited selection which I can only presume was intended for a British audience. (Don&#8217;t think my mates here would have agreed in a focus group!)</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used a yahoo service since. No, seriously, I haven&#8217;t used Yahoo. As soon as Konfabulator was purchased by Yahoo, I uninstalled it. I was all set to set up a Flickr account, when I found out it was Yahoo. (I might go back on that one, once I get a decent digital camera.)</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t really a boycott so much as a pre-emptive decision. I know that as soon as Yahoo gets a hold of a service, its user-friendliness will dissolve into advertisements and &#8216;premium services&#8217; (a contradiction in terms!) This is what Hulu reminds me of. An attempt at grabbing a market instead of a well-thought-out startup trying to sell a genuinely good service and make a profit on its quality.</p>
<p>What is Web 2.0? Hulu doesn&#8217;t know, and it makes me think that News Corp hasn&#8217;t really got its head round it at all. I shudder to think <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/news-corp-looking-to-buy-linkedin">what&#8217;s going to happen with LinkedIn</a>.</p>
