								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/twitter_banned_from_white_house.php">read</a> yesterday that twitter has been banned from the White House. In the post, Marshall Kirkpatrick joked that this could be a reason we haven&#8217;t seen much from Obama&#8217;s twitter stream recently. I must admit however, my initial reaction was sympathetic with the White House for pragmatic reasons, though the attitude of the Press Secretary&#8217;s attitude towards &#8220;twitterers&#8221; did raise the hackles. It makes sense to be secure in the White House, to make sure people aren&#8217;t saying things which could be dangerous or cause scandal through carelessness. &#8220;Loose lips sink ships&#8221;, don&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>But I think there is a wider idea here, which I think I&#8217;ve glimpsed between the lines.</p>

I use it to pass on little observations, like you might to a room full of mates, when there isn&#8217;t anyone there to share with directly. News of Michael Jackson&#8217;s death reached me via an off-colour joke on twitter. These are uses for a technology which it would be difficult to commend.</p>
<p>However, I also use twitter to share news. When my grandfather recently passed away, I received dozens of messages of encouragement and sympathy. Several of us here in Shropshire organise a monthly get together to network and discuss tech-trends and the work we do through the <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/shropgeek">@shropgeek</a>. Important announcements at work, and shared interest groups often rely on twitter for their spread and response, and I&#8217;ve had customer service reps from big companies personally respond to my feedback. Of far more significance, the government of Iran was unable to stop twitter, allowing its citizens to tell the rest of the world what was going on when all other forms of communication were censored, blocked, or monitored. And citizens from around the rest of the world responded.</p>
<p>twitter is a medium, and suggesting someone is petty and fatuous because they use it is like suggesting everyone on TV is unimportant or vain. There is no connection between the inane talk-show host and the investigative journalist or head of state! The point is in the message, not the vehicle. But, the point this raises in my mind is that twitter, and other forms of web-enabled channels make for a high level of transparency, and I don&#8217;t think the US (in particular) is a power who likes transparency at the moment.</p>
<p>This has lead me to question what I think of the use of web-media by politicians and important figures, particularly in the US and UK. It makes me wonder whether the &#8220;Loose lips&#8221; philosophy is misguided in the modern world. You see, closing channels, blocking communication, and monitoring messages suggests a democracy that doesn&#8217;t trust its citizens with the truth. Sure, there are controls and securities which must be in place, and I&#8217;m not suggesting for a moment that every clerk should have a constitutional right to twitter state-secrets&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;or am I?</p>
<p>You see, the United States is global super-power on par with, and probably only directly comparable with great states of the past called Empires. The notion of an emperor of the US would chill the blood of most of my family, and thinking of the US as anything but a &#8220;democracy&#8221; is practically heresy. After all, citizens&#8217; rights are ensconced in the very foundation myth and history of the US itself. &#8220;We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal&#8230;&#8221; begins a letter to a despotic monarch, sparking off the touch-pad for liberating men from the rule of figureheads, class and social bondage. But part of this very myth* that the Republic, &#8220;of the people, by the people and for the people&#8221; should be based on citizenship trusted to look after themselves and even take up arms to defend their status as such citizens. There is a deep-running notion in the American psyche that if the government were ever to get too big for it&#8217;s boots, it is the right—nay, duty—of her citizens to act to reduce her power.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t believe the US is a state that can be corrected by its citizens very effectively at all.  I think of the complexity, size, presence and byzantine nature of the US Government, and I feel disconnected, small, and powerless to change anything. Over the past decade, in the name of security, Americans put up with reductions in liberty, and I think this principle is bleeding through the cracks in the facade of governance. Blocking channels is saying: &#8220;we don&#8217;t trust you&#8221;.</p>
<p>What would a country look like where the public had access to the vast majority of government information? Where government officially made use of the media its citizens used? Where government officials were held accountable via the various media whenever they were caught being mis-represented?</p>
<p>Oddly, I think it&#8217;s the UK.</p>
<p>The &#8220;traditional&#8221; media here are a powerful force. It is seen as a near human right to have intimate news of public officials and dealings, and watching politicians being interviewed by members of the press is like eaves-dropping on a job interview or witnessing a cautious father&#8217;s first meeting of a prospective suitor for his only daughter. The press is a force to be reckoned with here, and it&#8217;s not seen as the trustworthy force itself, but is is composed of citizens, not officials.</p>
<p>Does this scandalise the government? Yes&#8230; and no. There is a very different attitude toward elected officials here, which doesn&#8217;t translate easily to American. A Member of Parliament is legally referred to as &#8220;Honourable Member&#8221;, but the &#8220;honourable&#8221; is not taken as read by the average Brit. For decades, for example, Members of Parliament have enjoyed a system of expenses whereby they can claim for nearly every cost of living: from second homes to food and utilities. The true level of this feeding-trough has recently been blown wide by the press (who subsequently have been enjoying their own self-congratulatory feast, but that is another post.)</p>
<p>But, I think the UK get the web, probably because it&#8217;s used to dealing with powerful media. I follow Number 10 Downing Street (the metonymic residence of the Prime Minister) on twitter. No 10 doesn&#8217;t say much, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to expose any state secrets, but I like the fact that it&#8217;s there to be engaged. The Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) hosts an important blog which outlines the government&#8217;s plans to expose public data for normal, every-day citizens to have a play with and to see what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>And, in the last few weeks, the Prime Minister himself has turned himself around almost 180º in my personal opinion. He represents a party for whom I have less time than either of the other major contenders, and I&#8217;ve rather lazily accepted him as an incompetent oaf. But, he&#8217;s finally earned my pint and invite to dinner, if not my vote (if any of his secretaries are reading this, just tweet your acceptance, and I&#8217;ll find some pheasants and Pinotage). A few weeks ago, he appointed Sir Tim Berners-Lee to a Parliamentary advisory role with the explicit intention of opening up and pushing public data online. This is a <strong>major</strong> point, because it leads to transparency through public accountability. There seems to be a movement for Parliament to see public data as belonging to the people who bought it with their taxes, and this seems to be the most democratic way to see it. His recent <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/gordon_brown.html">TED talk</a> also made me think he&#8217;s got a lot more to say than he perhaps has to date; though I think many of his points raise more questions than they answer.</p>
<p>Much has been said in the online world about the new American administration&#8217;s use of social media and the web to mobilise supporters during the election. But there hasn&#8217;t been much since. President Obama launched <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/www.data.gov">data.gov</a>, but there is very little data there. I think the web is seen as a tool for messages, as a part of a bigger campaign, and as a security breach. It&#8217;s something to be used with your own agenda, and only under one&#8217;s own strict parameters. And, perhaps most non-democratically, it&#8217;s been used to broadcast and to cajole—It has not been used to engage. The fact that social media have barely been touched since the election could point to a wider attitude that citizens only matter for the brief time they&#8217;re required to vote.</p>
<p>The UK has already exposed much of its public data, and it&#8217;s planning to publish more and more as Linked Data (machine-readable, immediately useful resources), and it&#8217;s made plans to be more open, grasping the web and the transparency it&#8217;s brought through the hard lessons that spin is impossible with a well-informed citizenry, and on the Open Web, there is less room for your own message than there is for humanity.</p>
<p>*<em>mythos is greek for &#8220;story&#8221;, and it is from that perspective I use the word <em>myth</em>: that it conveys the notion of a commonly-held understanding, not that it is entirely fantastic or without truth.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-click" style="margin: 1em; float: left; display: block;">
<div style="width: 212px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/Image:Haliaeetus_leucocephalus2.jpg"><img title="Adult landing on nest" src="https://i2.wp.com/zachbeauvais.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/202px-Haliaeetus_leucocephalus2.jpg?resize=202%2C252" alt="Adult landing on nest" width="202" height="252" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>
</div>
<p>This morning, after switching on the kettle, I set my laptop on the kitchen surface and shuffled through the BBC iPlayer&#8217;s &#8220;Factual&#8221; category—looking for something interesting to keep me company as I made my porridge and coffee. I stumbled across <em>Question Time</em>, and noticed that this special edition was being broadcast from the United States—something to do with an election? I was thrilled to discover the entire panel was American, with the notable exception of a personal hero of mine: British professor of history at Columbia University <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/7658904.stm">Simon Schama</a>.</p>
<p>Things, however, did not go according to plan, and I was very soon restraining myself from damaging my employers&#8217; Macbook with the wooden spoon I&#8217;d shortly before been using to stir my porridge. After realising that unless I switched off the iPlayer in short order, I&#8217;d either have to remove the spoon from the screen or from my clenched teeth.</p>
<p>I took a minute to reflect on my reaction.</p>
<p>As a quick introduction to <em>Question Time</em>, for my American readers—clearly something the audience at this recording had been denied—the format of the programme is straightforward. David Dimbleby chairs a panel of note-worthies, and selects from a series of questions submitted by the audience for the panel to answer one by one. It is a political programme which has featured many of the most important British figures including Tony Blair—while still Prime Minister. The panel usually consists of a politician or two, a political theorist or commentator (often an academic) and, often, a slightly more off-beat character such as <a href="http://beggingaquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/watch?v=EajKlwB30L0">Ian Hislop</a>.<br />
[blockquote type=&#8221;blockquote_quotes&#8221; align=&#8221;right&#8221;]Which candidate does the panel believe could and would restore America&#8217;s battered image abroad?&#8221;[/blockquote]
<p>Dimbleby: Which candidate does the panel believe could and would restore America&#8217;s battered image abroad?&#8221;</p>
<p>Schama: &#8220;Barak Obama&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Appreciative applause.</em></p>
<p>The historian then outlined his reasoning that the Democratic candidate&#8217;s heterogeneous past and perspective of global citizenship could only help America&#8217;s &#8220;perhaps undeserved,&#8221; tarnished foreign reputation. Specifically, Schama noted, the rhetoric of war as a last resort rather than an simply useful option could play an important role in diplomatic relationships.</p>
<p>One of the other panelists, this time from a more Republican-friendly platform, stated that he believed John McCain would fulfill this role more effectively.</p>
<p><em>Cheering, whooping, and a few boos.</em></p>
<p>The panelist then went on to outline why he thought the reputation of the US is not tarnished in some places abroad, and that many African nations actually admire American foreign policy. He also stated that Iraq could turn out to be a dramatic success. Each of the rest of the panelists then discussed their preferences and reasoning.</p>
<p>Several audience members were then asked their views, and this is when my breakfast  began to take a less supportive role in my morning. One man was asked who he&#8217;d like to see in the White House, and his emphatic response of &#8220;John McCain&#8221; brought whoops and cheers before he could speak more of his mind.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, he did speak more.</p>
<p>With a notably impressive display of condescending superiority, the gentleman in an expensive suit addressed Simon Schama, beginning with: &#8220;You&#8217;re a typical professor. You are it. With all respect, our country is not hated overseas, I&#8217;ve been to fifty-five countries&#8230;&#8221; continuing that the US &#8220;brings hope to people&#8221; and that it is not hated overseas. &#8220;We&#8217;re the most charitable nation on earth, as evidenced by George Bush, and all the work he did&#8230;&#8221;</p>
[blockquote type=&#8221;blockquote_quotes&#8221; align=&#8221;left&#8221;]We are respected and loved by millions of people BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DO FOR THEM! AND WE DIE FOR THEM, AND WE DIE FOR THEM![/blockquote]
<p>His tone then took on a challenging note: &#8220;with all respect, don&#8217;t talk about our country being villafied overseas, when we are respected and loved by millions of people BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DO FOR THEM. [emphasis his, as he shouted over the cascade of applause and the chairman&#8217;s attempts to direct the discussion.] &#8220;AND WE DIE FOR THEM, AND WE DIE FOR THEM.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was already impressed by this increasingly visceral outburst, when he capped his performance with a patronisingly disgusted gesture allowing the typical professor his reply. As Schama began his response, the suited gentleman continued his tirade, raising his voice over the top of audience and Schama&#8230; and it all continued to escelate until eventually, Schama was able to say &#8220;if I&#8217;m a typical professor, you&#8217;re a typical blowhard; let me finish.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spoon, by now, was nowhere near the pan, and I found myself gawping at the screen in irrational hope that the man would shut up.</p>
<p>The problem, from my perspective, is not about which candidate wins this election, nor from which side of an all-but-imaginary political fence one happens to stare through. The problem is the offensive-defence of American rhetoric. It&#8217;s pre-emptive, visceral, and primitive. It makes respectable-looking people speak without thought. It damages credibility, and makes the speaker look like a bafoon. And I remember it firsthand.</p>
[blockquote type=&#8221;blockquote_line&#8221; align=&#8221;right&#8221;]The problem with this is that facts are tactical, discussion conduit, and people incidental.[/blockquote]
<p>Having been raised in the States, I know the blood-pounding-in-the-ears nature of political discussion. The goal is to be right, absolutely; and to make sure anyone watching knows you&#8217;re the <em>right</em> one. The problem with this is that facts are tactical, discussion conduit, and people incidental  It&#8217;s all a vehicle for your personal perspective (the right one) to be broadcast with as little ambiguity as possible. And this kind of debate might even lead to interesting dichotomies and contrasts if it wasn&#8217;t all done under the influence of adrenaline.</p>
<p>You see, from an outsider&#8217;s perspective, this suited businessman illustrated America. &#8220;We&#8217;re right!&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;re the most charitable!&#8221; &#8220;We fought for you!&#8221; &#8220;We freed Iraq, goddammit!&#8221; and: &#8220;We&#8217;re not hated abroad! Don&#8217;t tell me we&#8217;re hated, don&#8217;t <strong>you</strong> talk about <strong>our</strong> country&#8230;&#8221; The logical element of the discussion is abandoned, and it&#8217;s down to bare-knuckles. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand your words, man, cause my ears are throbbing, so I&#8217;m gunna <strong>SHOUT</strong> at you so I can hear my <strong>own damn voice</strong>!&#8221;</p>
<p>My response surprised me: I <em>tsk</em>ed, and muttered: &#8220;typical American, can&#8217;t see he&#8217;s trying to <em>tell</em> the world what <em>it</em> thinks.&#8221; I appreciated the irony of this hateful person insisting we&#8217;re not hated. I found the fact that a professor&#8217;s extraordinary career and the phrase &#8220;with all due respect&#8221; could be used as conduits for hatred actually quite funny. I would have laughed and enjoyed a British moment of personal, quiet exultation in the foolishness of the speaker if it hadn&#8217;t been for one thing.</p>
<p>The audience.</p>
<p>The audience rose to this diatribe with a fervency of whooping, cheering, clapping and shouting. The whole place suddenly became a bowl of people shouting down the suited man, the panel, Dimbleby and each other. I stood gobsmacked in my kitchen—spoon dripping oats onto the cat—and begged God not to let any of my friends watch this.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t watch it any longer; I switched it off and cried.</p>
<p>The thing that many Americans don&#8217;t realise, is that the rest of the world is watching what they do—but not out of jealousy or pride. Decisions and perspectives made in the country with the largest economy on the planet affect the rest of us, so we&#8217;re watching reasonably closely to get a glimpse of the future through the decisions being made now. And most of us can&#8217;t comprehend just how any decisions are made under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Until Americans are willing to put emotional defensiveness and denial aside from their rhetoric, there will be a continued decline in their perception overseas: regardless of political perspective, good deeds or noble willingness to sacrifice. And, by the way, America as a concept <em>is</em> hated by some people overseas. We need to deal with it, not shout them down or question their right to not like us very much.</p>
<p>And, the question came again to me: &#8220;Where are all the considerate, contempletative Americans I knew growing up? Where are the people who give more generously than any other nation? Where are the peace-makers and volunteers? Where are the AIDS workers, teachers, and nurses?&#8221; I only pray that when the hubris of the TV-talkers dies, the dignity I know lives on in the US is left standing.</p>
