								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I had a nightmare journey. It was the kind you think is made up by travel writers to pad out the pages between interesting sights and &#8216;how-to&#8217;s of ticket management. It didn&#8217;t help that my reason for going was to have a chat with the JobCentre Plus (Plus benefits, I assume) about allocation of a National Insurance number.</p>
<p>The first leg of the journey was fine: train to Shrewsbury. I sat down to enjoy a book and baguette (brilliant combination until you take a bite out of your novel) and noticed that the notice on the gantry sign kept changing: <b>next train</b>&#8211;<i>on time</i>&#8212;<b>next train</b>&#8211;<i>cancelled.</i> Well, which one is it? Turns out, I just had to wait 25 minutes for the next one. No worries, I&#8217;m reading and drinking caffeine-containing hot stuff (It&#8217;s not coffee. This is coffee.)</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m late into Telford, but I was going to be an hour early anyway. I have a Google Map printout, but I don&#8217;t want to risk it, so I jump in a Taxi, explaining that I&#8217;ll need cash first, then on to the Jobcentre Plus (Plus and Minus?). The Royal Bank of Scotland was just across the retail park which is Telford centre, so I tried to get cash out there&#8230; no luck. I shrug embarrassedly at the driver, who shakes his head as if to say: &#8220;Oh, bloody hell&#8230; I&#8217;m taking him to t&#8217;JobCentre Plus (Plus Jobs for foreigners, no doubt!) and he&#8217;s got no bloody money.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, across to Asda, which looks more hopeful&#8211;there being three cash machines from different banks. Brilliant&#8230;but no. &#8220;This service is temporarily unavailable,&#8221; from Abbey National. &#8220;Your card cannot be used in a  cash machine,&#8221; <i>(What&#8217;s it for then!?)</i> from NatWest, and a simple &#8220;Sorry, we cannot complete your request,&#8221; from the RBS. So, I phone my bank (don&#8217;t get me started on the poor customer service at HSBC!) and wade my way through the ridiculous menus.</p>
<p>I eventually get through to someone who talks&#8230;very&#8230;slowly&#8230;and&#8230;keeps&#8230;repeating&#8230;what&#8230;I&#8230;ask&#8230;back&#8230;to&#8230;me. I tell the poor dear I&#8217;m waiting by a taxi whose meter is running and that I need to use my card to get cash out&#8230; &#8220;One moment, Mr Zach. Do you mind if I call you Mr. Zach?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really couldn&#8217;t give a toss what you call me, love, I&#8217;m waiting to pay a disgruntled, bearded cab driver from Telford!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ok, Mr Zach. I&#8217;m just going to speak to one of my colleagues. Can I put you on hold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, bloody hell&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Mr Zach, it looks like there is sufficient funds for you to take cash out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know there&#8217;s money in the account. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m trying to take it out, to give to this increasingly red-faced cabbie!&#8221;</p>
<p>After another five minutes of this, it turns out there aren&#8217;t any security block on the account, so it&#8217;s probably the card. &#8220;I can send you out a new one, Mr. Zach. Would that be helpful?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not really&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Cabbie then drove me to a garage where I attempted to buy a pack of mentos to get cash back. They don&#8217;t do cash back&#8230; I&#8217;d have to go across to Asda&#8230;</p>
<p>Eventually, the driver asked me to buy 20 Embassy Filter. I bought 40&#8211;the first time I&#8217;ve ever bought a pack of fags&#8211;and he laughingly agreed to take me to the JobCentre Plus (Plus acrid, blue smoke, presumably).</p>
<p>He drops me off, at the wrong place, and I had to ask a Telfordian where the Jobcentre was. Luckily, I chose someone who looked like he&#8217;d been on the Dole, and he gave me very detailed directions&#8230; via three pubs and a discount £-store. Fanbloodytastic.</p>
<p>So, I have the interview (wasn&#8217;t actually too bad). And I finally worked out what the &#8216;Plus&#8217; is for. It&#8217;s for: &#8220;Plus unnecessary bureaucracy&#8221;. The lovely woman who conducted my interview had to fill in literally ten pages-worth of forms. Most of the information was on her screen, but it&#8217;s not secure until it&#8217;s been hand-scrawled into hundreds of little boxes, apparently. We shared a laugh at the ridiculousness of the system, and she kept on writing the entire time. That certainly explains the name. I think, however, they&#8217;ve made a serious marketing mistake. Since this country loves it some Acronyms (LISA), they should call it <i>Jobcentre Plus PUB</i>. It&#8217;d certainly fit the intended clientele.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t bore you with the return journey, except to say that it was cold, miserable, two delays and a cancellation. Oh, and it rained at Telford Central just as they announced that the Birmingham New Street train was cancelled. It was freezing, and so crowded I read my book using a shorter person like a lectern.</p>
