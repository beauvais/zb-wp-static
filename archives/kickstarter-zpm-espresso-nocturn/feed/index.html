* &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/magazine/zpm-espresso-and-the-rage-of-the-jilted-crowdfunder.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NY Times story&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/2sdxvk/zpm_espresso_team_officially_throw_in_the_towel/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reddit coverage&lt;/a&gt;

I don&#039;t think it was a scam, necessarily, but it was a failed project. I was excited to report on it way, way back when this post went out, and the team I communicated with were hopeful, friendly, and keen. But it wound down – it is no more. This post is from 2013. They wound down semi-officially in 2015. I was a backer, and got all the emails from Kickstarter, and it was painful to watch each delay. I feel sorry for the team, and I hope they&#039;ve found brilliant other things to do since.]]></description>
