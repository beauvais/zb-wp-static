					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m an atheist but I don&#039;t believe in a god for the same reason I don&#039;t believe in magic, fairies at the bottom of the garden, ghosts and homeopathy. It worries me that people do but assuming we&#039;re talking about adults that&#039;s their decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#039;t define my world view based on a disbelief in other people view and I don&#039;t believe many people do - remember we&#039;re all atheists I&#039;ve just gone one god more than yourself and you don&#039;t define your belief in  a non-belief in e.g. Zeus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where I do align myself with a tribe - is where religion seeks to or has acquired special treatment within a society. In the UK membership of a region gives you the right to discriminate against someone&#039;s world view and their sexuality; it allows you to discriminate against children in schools and one specific religion gives you a privileged position within the legislature. I happily align myself with a tribe to try to change this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does this make me a &#039;fundamentalist atheist&#039;? No. A fundamentalist holds aÂ belief/ adherence to a set of basicÂ principles (independent of evidence), for me, and I suspect most atheists, our beliefs aren&#039;t defined buy our lack of belief rather by our belief in evidence, rational thought and equality, in other words the fundamentalism doesn&#039;t refer to our lack of belief in a god (any more than it does to a lack of belief in ghosts) but to a belief in the ration and evidence based decision making.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Alan, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hard part, for me, is balancing the corporate and the personal. Part of the beauty of Christianity to me, is its insistence that an individual is not at the centre of the universe. By that, I mean the continued teaching of selflessness, of giving and of forgiving. Many religious leaders from Christianity&#039;s past have been terrible at this, but it&#039;s still the fundamental doctrine of Christianity. The goal is to be less selfish, more willing to accept people from any part of society, and toâ€”quite literallyâ€”put up with one another. (It&#039;s a command in Ephesians ;) ).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting post, Zach. You&#039;ve identified the main conundrum. Some of Ayn Rand&#039;s work (e.g., Atlas Shrugged) appealed to me in the past, but I now I believe her world view was flawed (or at least her semantics were flawed). She misled people who remain confused to this day about the value of serving others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus wasn&#039;t divine, but he had a clue. In Bob Dylan&#039;s words, you gotta serve somebody. Otherwise, life just isn&#039;t fulfilling. The best way to serve is to tap into, develop and deliver on your deepest talents in a way that helps the community at large. The payoff is in improving the lives of others, in making a difference somehow. I&#039;m not religious myself, but I know more religious people who lead by example than I do Randians and other atheists. Hardly a valid sample, I know... But think about how sour and cynical many prominent atheists are. When you write off billions of religious people, you&#039;ve cut yourself off from the world. That was Rand&#039;s fundamental mistake.]]></description>
