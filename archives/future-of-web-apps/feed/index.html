					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi Zach, we swapped comments a few weeks back about Swirrl, our wiki for data with semantic cherries on top.  We&#039;re going to be exhibiting at FOWA, so do come by the stand and we&#039;ll tell you all about it. It would be a pleasure to meet you and to hear more about Talis.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree - the speaker line-up looks really interesting, and you never know I might be able to sneak away from our stand for some of the talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS You asked before about a beta invite - we decided in the end to keep our beta test reasonably limited and will launch a public version 1 later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
