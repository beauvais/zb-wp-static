					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;And another:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Is it right for someone to make a decision which affects other people when that decision is based on the teaching of a religious institution? Is it any more or less right than making decisions based on current scientific consensus?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on the decision, surely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone making decisions needs to take into account everything they can. Can you not think of a single decision in which thousands of years of human knowledge can help inform? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think people with faith are diametrically opposed to scientific &quot;consensus&quot;. Also, which consensus? You also can&#039;t tell me that scientists all agree about everything, can you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t believe that a person making important decisions should do so without thinking for herself. Important decisions shouldn&#039;t be based on &quot;the teachings of a religious institution&quot; (unless, of course, the religious institution is elected as a political party, right?). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that tradition, faith and personal conviction can inform and assist in decisions. And I believe &quot;science&quot; which is after all a process (scientific method) and a collection of amassed human knowledge, is simply the grist for the decision mill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not defend the teachings of a religious institution over scientific finding, but I don&#039;t think that the default is a diametric opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the tone of this line of questions feels like a sort of assumed evil in every religious person; as if every single individual with religious beliefs is opposed to science, and incapable of making decisions. It feels elitist, and that is; in my opinion, the opposite of scientific reason—which should be indifferent, objective, and... reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The following anonymous comment was left on formspring, following is also my reply.&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Does your previous answer imply you&#039;d be happy with a Catholic PM pushing through laws to outlaw homosexuality and contraception? This PM may believe they are absolutely right, but is it serving the best interests of society?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;/me sighs.No, nothing in my previous answer aligned my own perspective with the perspectives of any particular religion. I even said there were situations where the professions of a particular group (I even implied catholics with reference to celibate priests) would or could be suspect.It&#039;s a hell of a logical jump from: &quot;Can/should someone set aside their religion to be a politician?&quot; (my inferred thesis from the previous question) to: &quot;So, you&#039;d be happy with a theocratic dictator ruining our sex lives?&quot; (That&#039;s my hyperbolic inference.)No, I would not be happy for someone in a position of authority to make decisions about community health not based on evidence. I think health is one of the clearest areas for this to be applied. I expect people to think for themselves, and I&#039;m troubled by &quot;religiosity&quot; myself. (see my previous answers here for a fuller context)I have a problem with people who profess sense over bullshit going all senseless when it comes to someone having spiritual aspect to their lives.I don&#039;t think people can easily set aside their convictions when making decisions. Should they?&lt;/p&gt;
