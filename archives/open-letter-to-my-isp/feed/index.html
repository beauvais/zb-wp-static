					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Well, I&#039;m quite happy with Virgin cable.  I&#039;ve just done a speed test, and I get 2056 kb/s down, and 237 kb/s up.  I&#039;ve never noticed any kind of slowdown, and we regularly use it quite a lot.  I&#039;ve got to say that it&#039;s died altogether a few times, but when it works, it works, whether my neighbours are downloading from iPlayer or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the different ISP thing?  That&#039;s from it checking who owns the netblock your IP address comes from.  Mine says &#039;Telewest Broadband&#039;, which doesn&#039;t even exist any more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck with it all.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll have to remember that, though so far it&#039;s all been emails, which are easier to collate. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s more to do with the shite coverage our area gets from BT than it is to do with the ISP itself (they&#039;re just re-sellers anyway, I assume). We&#039;re not covered by cable, unbundled ADSL, or fibre-optic, so all we can hope for is the normal broadband, degrading every time someone else watches iPlayer after work. 

At 10 this morning my speeds were nice and zippy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.speedtest.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.speedtest.net/result/410125316.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Last evening they were barely 1MB. (NB, that shows a different ISP to the one I signed up for... maybe they&#039;re in it together?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I was with BT at home and whilst I was running my old business. Even though they were entirely different contracts and departments they still managed to simultaneously knock out both services (some happy &#039;coincidence&#039;. Imagine a professional web developer, running a web design firm with no Internet at home or at work: they crippled us for about 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of this palaver was when an engineer, sent to install our service damaged the local exchange and knocked out a few postcodes in the process, when they restored the service it was at a severley diminished speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After meticulously logging every conversation and call I made to BT, I finally threatened them with legal action and only then did they offer to transfer me to an English complaints resolution team. Bear in mind that this is about 4 months down the line with no Internet at home, the resolution team got an engineer out to the exchange who resolved the problem in within 2 days. Apparently there was some switches and gizmos that weren&#039;t quite right and some dongle needed upgrading in there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then got a credit note for a years free line rental and broadband both at home and at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Log your calls, and try and get your case escalated at every opportunity and eventually you&#039;ll probably meet someone with the authority to do more than just read a script. Also don&#039;t use any BT equipment, it&#039;s absolute garbage don&#039;t even try and sell it: you&#039;ll get nothing for it and it&#039;s morally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with Sky, and I get about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.speedtest.net/result/410116793.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;75% of the &quot;up to&quot; speed&lt;/a&gt; which I think is well above average and we&#039;ve never had a single problem with the service or the equipment. Still considering Virgin though....&lt;/p&gt;
