					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I agree with the writer. I have been toying with the idea of purchasing an iPad. My parents got one and it just sits there. It is cool but at the end of the day, and you want to write something, well, a trusty laptop is great. &lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;But I WANT them to be successful- the whole idea is so cool.  Something with a screen large enough not to go blind trying to read (ie NOT a smart phone), and NOT heavy enough to make your chiropractor rich (ie NOT a laptop), that can sit beside you in the living room for those quick &quot;I wonder what the GDP of Puerto Rico&quot; answers, or to take on the plane with you ....
Admittedly, my HTC EVO is a giant step in the right direction, but still, the whole idea of that much computer in something the size of a pad of paper is intoxicating...&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I tend to agree. Used a friends iPad while on holiday and loved it. Then took the plunge and bought one. Decided it wasn&#039;t as useful or even as good as my iPhone 4 and promptly returned it (buyers remorse). Maybe iPad 2 will be lots better (not that iPad 1 is particularly shoddy) but I keep wondering what place it has for someone with a laptop and smart phone..&lt;/p&gt;
