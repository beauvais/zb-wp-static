					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is an important concession on the part of Google considering they&#039;ve spent the last few years dismissing  the importance of structured data and semantic mark up.  It goes to show that what was basically an academic initiative by Berners-Lee and the w3c can make an impact in the commercial sector and obligate business interests to conform to regulatory standards.  Now if we can just get the banking and investment businesses in line . . .&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Good point... Makes me wonder if there&#039;ll be an arms-race for SEO-folk to start microformatting all their product sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus-side, it could trigger some interesting innovation in the field of human/RDFa interaction, couldn&#039;t it?&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Google&#039;s previous experiments with explicit statements have generally ended with Google deciding they are untrustworthy, too many people make intentionally false explicit statements in an effort to game the search results. Eg previous support for &#039;meta&#039; tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonder what they&#039;re doing different this time.&lt;/p&gt;
