					<description><![CDATA[The main color for this year, in my opinion should be black. There are too many killings and lost this year. Not to mention the suicide bomb attacks took place in the Middle East, there are too many innocent victims in these attacks. I do not know what kind of statement they are trying to make out, to them, these attacks could be regarded as the holy wars against the foreign invaders, but to me they are all terrorist attacks. And the mass shooting happened recently in the Fort Hood military base could be a sharp knife pierce through our heart. Once we thought that the America continent is the safest land in this world, nothing bad from the outside war would shock our life, but the true is we were wrong. The gun shooting might wake lots of people’s dreams. &lt;br&gt;  Besides these bad things, the one on the top for at least two years is the news of Michael Jackson’s death and this news would decide that the main color for the New Year’s Party should be black. My friends and I are now preparing for the New Year’s Party and we had bought dozens of black rubber wristbands. We do want our party to be the most exciting one, but we also want to memorize the King of Pop. I could see the scene of that party: we would sit together in a circle and listen to Michael Jackson’s songs. &lt;br&gt;  Bad things happen every day; the bad things happened this year are not the special cases. We had lost so many great people in the past, such as Elvis Presley, John Lennon and so on. We have to survivor in this world so we could not sunk ourselves in the sadness. At least these bad news have good part, the death of Michael Jackson made us to know that we love him though he was in trouble and was fastened by affairs before his death.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thank you. It&#039;s strange how the heart has always been a human weakness. It&#039;s even a metaphor for tenderness. You never expect to lose a friend at 27 though, no matter how tender.&lt;/p&gt;
