					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Zach- I think the first interesting dataset (beyond just what I need to make light switches work) is the &quot;personal news&quot;. At the right time, maybe during breakfast, the house should start talking to me about my calendar, overdue todo items, a summary of new blog posts I might be interested in, a summary of who&#039;s answered my emails, etc. Read any new identica messages addressed to me. Report on my bank accounts from a wesabe.com download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the heater, I managed to get good control with this relay:
http://photo.bigasterisk.com/2007/event/heater?current=http://photo.bigasterisk.com/digicam/dl-2008-02-15/IMG_0708.JPG&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board also tries to measure whether something -else- has turned the heater on so I can track how many hours it runs per month, but that sensor misses a lot. Once we stop being interested in the old thermostat (because the new interfaces are better), that sensor won&#039;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;drewp: Nice! Is this the first &quot;Semantic House&quot;? What sort of dataset would you be most likely to tie to, do you reckon, in order to augment your own personal &quot;smart home&quot;? I&#039;ve lived in houses where the boilers need a certain something I&#039;m not sure software can deliver:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/me: beat with hammer; button-hold=&quot;3-seconds(±time till the smell of gas)&quot;; click sparker repeatedly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrian: yep, I know exactly what you mean. In 2008 I still have to x____________ (insert tedious process here) I&#039;m still waiting for a coffee machine that knows what I like, and music in every room without spending £3k on a system that&#039;ll be obsolete from the manufacturers in half a year...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&#039;s the next, most logical thing to automate, do you reckon?&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Not only do I already have the problem where a computer could burn my house down by turning on the heater continuously for hours, but I use RDF for the sensor and output descriptions! I&#039;m hoping to use n3 logic for the rules in between, although I&#039;m not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some devices:
http://bigasterisk.com/darcs/?r=room;a=headblob;f=/devices.n3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the hack reasoner, to be replaced with a real inference engine:
http://bigasterisk.com/darcs/?r=room;a=headblob;f=/reasoning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPARQL in use for the setup of some output pins on a parallel port:
