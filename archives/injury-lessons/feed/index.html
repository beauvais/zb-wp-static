					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi Jfrodsla, sorry not to reply after nearly a year. I seem to have had some issues with my commenting system. Thank you so much for your comment, and I wish you all the best in a very difficult field.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;You wrote &quot;Each time I asked, I watched as they read my chart and assured me it wasn’t, that I just had a concussion and nothing broken.“Keep it moving, so it doesn’t become stiff.”I cannot remember a single doctor or nurse looking at my shoulder, just my notes.I sadly learned not to trust the advice that comes first if it seems wrong.&quot; 
I hope no one skims by that section. I have been an RN for over 10 years and I am always looking for more examples of &quot;good care vs bad care&quot; to share with the new nurses I precept, so I hope you won&#039;t mind if I use this.  You are correct and I encourage all people to remind their providers to look again if the chart doesn&#039;t match the patient&#039;s story.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I would also add a few additional studies: http://www.bma.org.uk/health&lt;em&gt;promotion&lt;/em&gt;ethics/transport/promotingsafecycling.jsp?page=5, http://www.rospa.com/roadsafety/info/cycle_helmets.pdf, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because there&#039;s a discussion among the community about how good all the studies are doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s better not to wear a helmet than not to. It seems mostly overwhelmingly a good personal decision to wear a helmet. Other factors, such as a helmet &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; preventing accidents (of course it doesn&#039;t), don&#039;t reduce the effectiveness of it in the case of an accident happening. So the conclusion to not wear a helmet, based on studies sounds hard to justify to me.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I can see that there are confusing ways of testing the trends, but there are plenty of stats showing effectiveness of helmets in a population. However, the risk and benefit that needs to be compared is in the individual—to make a decision to wear or not—not on the population. It is very different to say that increasing the use of helmet use in a population doesn&#039;t necessarily reduce accidents or damage, than to say it&#039;s not effective for an individual to wear a helmet or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That site seems to make a basic mistake of discussing the effect of legislation, which is a very different set of variables again. The circumstances they&#039;re discussing are in the interaction between numbers of cyclists on the road (more is safer, apparently) due to helmet laws, not on the effects of damage to wearers or not. If you reduce the number of cyclists (which is an unintended effect of the legislation) you see more accidents. (Via Wikipedia source: http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/3/205). This means that it is more debatable about legislation than about wearing a helmet at all. I personally feel that if someone refuses to ride because of a compulsory helmet legislation, that person is wasting the option to ride! (Unless it is a decision based on religious garments, in which case it&#039;s a harder decision for them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the most important study centre in the world, the Cochrane Collaboration published a very straightforward paper: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD001855/frame.html. I am a firm truster in the Cochrane method and the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on balance, I wouldn&#039;t insist someone wears a helmet, but would encourage it. If they&#039;re less likely to cycle with one, I&#039;d suggest they&#039;re missing out on a wonderful ride. Through the Cochrane publication and my own skull fracture thanks to not wearing a helmet (I cannot believe that I&#039;d be worse off or the same if I had worn one) I&#039;ll continue to wear one, as soon as I can get back on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sorry but it&#039;s quite an unscientific conclusion you come to mate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;More generally, concerns have been expressed that helmets may increase the risk of the most serious types of head injury typical of road crashes and which involve rotational forces [9].&quot; - Just one of the more surprising lines from the following website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.cyclehelmets.org/1013.html - this particular page is a summary of several academic studies, please read!
I know it&#039;s a real game of chances, Zach but the evidence does not stack up in favour of helmets; quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;weighing up risks and statistics, it would be clear that the ones who should be wearing helmets are in fact car drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not think that this is a simple health and safety overreaction, but I do think that a wave of assumption has swept the country from the 1980&#039;s that helmets save lives, an intuitive conclusion, which is not supported by statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the countries introducing mandatory wearing of cycle helmets seeing a large drop in cycling, the health and safety case alone is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am just very glad that you are recovering well, but I will not be donning a helmet.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Not sure I&#039;d make a particularly attractive poster, but maybe the half-working face would have helped ;) I&#039;ve always thought wearing a helmet is a good idea, but hadn&#039;t realised how important they really are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the message, too. I&#039;m glad to be back online and actually involved again.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A Question from Formspring about this piece, and my response: wear a helmet, it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I read your blog about your bike injury. I hope you make a full recovery. I was wondering were you wearing a bicycle helmet at the time? I cycle regularly without a helmet. Given the extent of your injuries I am now considering wearing one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I was not wearing a helmet, and I would strongly recommend wearing one. This was the first time I didn&#039;t wear protective head gear, and thanks to cracking my skull, I cannot remember why. I assume it was a simple slip of the mind—I always wear a helmet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was excited about the arrival of my new bike. It&#039;d taken me months to choose which make and model of bike I wanted, and ended up investing in something I&#039;m happy with. When it arrived, fully assembled and ready to ride in a huge brown box, I left it three days, while I found a helmet. It was torture, but I had to wait till I went into work and find one before I let myself ride the new wheels. So I have no idea why I decided to head out without wearing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, given the skull-bashing, I think a helmut would have meant I would remember what happened, and would have been able to walk to my front door, and ask my wife to drive me to hospital, and get my shoulder looked at. It seems very unlikely I&#039;d have damaged my head, lost memory, and been off work for 5 weeks if I&#039;d worn a helmet. I would probably have broken my collar bone, but would have recovered quicker and been able to tell the story from memory, instead of patching it together from the state of my bike, the splattering of impressive amounts of blood on my road, and the rather unpleasant half-paralysed face to work out what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll gladly send you a helmet from Amazon if that&#039;d convince you to wear one.&lt;/p&gt;
