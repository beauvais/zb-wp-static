					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My feelings exactly - i entered the UK and have thus far been on a working holiday visa, a work permit and now a marriage visa. I am currently &#039;studying&#039; the wonderful book life in the UK a journey to citizinship in preparation for the wonderful exam. I dare not add up the costs of all my visas and yet still will not have &#039;recourse to public funds&#039;. My husband and I dare not start a family for fear of the costs and implications that too will make on my status in the country. Yet ever time you turn on the TV you hear about these imigrants draining the country - i&#039;d like to know who they are and how the hell they are doing it!&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Quite right, another immigrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just saw the news about London Mayor In Favour Of Immigrant Amnesty (http://londonist.com/2009/03/mayor&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;favour&lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt;immigrant_amnest.php) which based on five years continuous residency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been living in this country legally for 9 years and contributing to its economy. Are we no better than illegal immigrants?&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is so true. I understand that UK is an island therefore cannot expand land/have limited resources, but the immigration measures are just far too much. What beats me is that if I work hard to earn a living, I need to pay for everything including all the fees mentioned above, but if I throw my passport in the bin and shout &#039;I am from xxx(insert a favouite poor country that lead by a dictator) and will be procecuted&quot; - then suddenly, I will get every benefit you can think of, have 10 children and pay NONE of those high fees AND lawyer fees!&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Reading your comment saddens me, Sheng. I hope you are able to find stability soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&#039;t help but think that this will become more common, now that the government is strapped for cash and looking to cut spending wherever it can. It feels inevitable that they&#039;ll make popular-seeming changes which, ultimately, will ruin any chance the UK has to attract top talent. I know of others who are going home, some to other EU countries, others further afield. I wonder what it will look like in another five years, once most of the brightest have gone back or moved on somewhere more supportive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to &quot;Anonymouse&quot;, I think you should re-read the article, follow the links to the reference materiel, and think harder before commenting on an editorial again. You&#039;re unlikely to attract esteem by poorly-articulating a call for the abolition of immigration on the blog of an immigrant, don&#039;t you think? Also, how do you mean: &quot;No offence&quot;? Do you think it excuses your position, or merely your decision to comment? If you are not looking to offend, may I suggest you make the decision not to post in future?&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great post! You&#039;ve said everything that we non-EU immigrants feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband and I are immigrant too. We were born and raised in China, and have lived in the UK since 2000. Our two children were born in UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both have PhD degrees. I did my Master and PhD in UK and worked here since. We bought home here. We have paid income tax, NI contribution, council tax... but don&#039;t have access to public funds. My children born in UK don&#039;t get child benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet we still haven&#039;t got indefinite leave to remain. Every now and then we have to pay a fortune to extend our visa and be &#039;humiliated&#039; by Home Office if we went there in person trying to get the visa on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I posted my application with passports to Home Office and waited for 6 months. When my passport was returned I found that I was only granted 6 months Leave to remain, which means by the time I received my passport, my visa would expire again soon and I have to post it to Home Office for another extension!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I absolutely agree your comments that we are a cash-cow for a cash-greedy government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under　UK&#039;s very　selective immigration system, non-EU migrant workers are likely to be top-of-the-cream in other countries.　As a result, UK has already taken great advantage by luring the top people to contribute in its economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the best ten years in our life (20s-30s) in UK. Our children speak perfect English that you can&#039;t tell from local kids. Yet, we&#039;re still not qualified for indefinite leave to remain. UK government has changed its immigration policy too often and broken its promises to immigrants again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now again, Jacqui Smith’s change aims to hard-working high-skill immigrant workers who contribute to the society but not effect illegal immigrants, assylum seekers, EU Immigrants, or terrorists at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This country is becoming greedy and hostile to hard-working high-skill immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes &#039;the straw that broke the camel&#039;s back&#039;, we are seriously consider leaving though it might be difficult for our English-speaking children.&lt;/p&gt;
