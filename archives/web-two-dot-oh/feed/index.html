					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi, Jill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just noticed your comment. It kind of makes me wonder whether you read my post, though? I don&#039;t really think we&#039;re riding anyone&#039;s coat-tails, and I have to say I&#039;m not sure I know where you&#039;re coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web 3.0, I suggest, is a convenience label, and it&#039;s not about a single technology, innovation, or trend. I&#039;ve always shied away from using terms which are predictive rather than descriptive, and I think &quot;Web 3.0&quot; is a good candidate for the media to use (as in, I predict they will, at least for a while). But I think it&#039;s important that the notion suggested by the version-number metaphor of one web supplanting the previous one in a sort or succession is not accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, have a read of my article, and note what I said about the convergence of trends. I&#039;d be interested to know what you think after reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
